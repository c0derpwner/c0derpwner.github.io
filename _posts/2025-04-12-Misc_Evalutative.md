Evaluating a Polynomial in Python

In mathematics and computer science, evaluating a polynomial at a given point is a common task. This article explains a simple Python script that accomplishes this. The polynomial is expressed in the following form:
P(x)=a0+a1x+a2x2+⋯+an−1xn−1
P(x)=a0​+a1​x+a2​x2+⋯+an−1​xn−1

where a0,a1,…,an−1a0​,a1​,…,an−1​ are the coefficients, and xx is the value at which the polynomial is evaluated.
The Python Code

Below is the Python code that reads the coefficients and the evaluation point, then computes and prints the polynomial's value:
```py
# Read coefficients (e.g., "1 -2 3" for polynomial 1 - 2x + 3x^2)
coefficients = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Read the evaluation point, x
x = int(input())

# Initialize result
result = 0

# Evaluate the polynomial: a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + ... + a_{n-1}*x^{n-1}
for power, coef in enumerate(coefficients):
    result += coef * (x ** power)

# Print the evaluated result
print(result)
```



### Detailed Explanation

1. Reading the Input

    Coefficients:
    The line:

coefficients = list(map(int, input().split()))

reads a single line of space-separated integers. For instance, if you input:

1 -2 3 it produces a list of integers: [1, -2, 3]

This list represents the coefficients a0a0​, a1a1​, and a2a2​ of the polynomial:
P(x)=1−2x+3x2
P(x)=1−2x+3x2

Evaluation Point:
The next line:

`x = int(input())`

reads another input which is the value of xx where the polynomial will be evaluated. For example, if you input: 2 then x=2x=2. 



by the way input() can be done also like this:

```py
def input(prompt=""):
    random_values = " ".join(str(random.randint(-100, 100)) for _ in range(10))
    print(random_values)
    return random_values
```


#### Polynomial Evaluation

The polynomial is computed using a loop:

    Initialization:

result = 0

initializes a variable to accumulate the sum of each term.

Looping Over Coefficients:
The loop:

    for power, coef in enumerate(coefficients):
        result += coef * (x ** power)

    works as follows:

        enumerate(coefficients) iterates over the list, providing both the index (power) and the coefficient (coef).

        For each coefficient, the term coef×xpowercoef×xpower is computed.

        This term is added to result.

3. Mathematical Breakdown

The code implements the mathematical formula for polynomial evaluation:
P(x)=∑i=0n−1aixi
P(x)=i=0∑n−1​ai​xi

For each term:

    aiai​ is the coefficient at position ii,

    xixi is xx raised to the power ii.

The loop iterates over each coefficient and calculates the term aixiai​xi before adding it to the cumulative result.
4. Example Walkthrough

Let's consider an example:

    Input Coefficients:

1 -2 3

represents the polynomial:
P(x)=1−2x+3x2
P(x)=1−2x+3x2

Input Evaluation Point:

2

Calculation:

    For i=0i=0: 1×20=11×20=1

    For i=1i=1: −2×21=−4−2×21=−4

    For i=2i=2: 3×22=123×22=12

Summing these up:
P(2)=1−4+12=9
P(2)=1−4+12=9

Output: The script prints:

    9

Conclusion

This Python script is a straightforward implementation of polynomial evaluation using basic programming constructs. By reading a list of coefficients and an evaluation point from the user, it computes the polynomial value using a loop and the power operator. This approach not only demonstrates fundamental programming skills but also illustrates how mathematical concepts are implemented in code.

Whether you're working on homework, developing mathematical software, or just learning Python, this example provides a clear method to combine programming with mathematics.
